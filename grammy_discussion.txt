 I just saw that video from the red carpet where she snapped at her stylist I just need the dress to be my dress thank you and I really did not like that she did that Its a side of her Ive never seen She clearly hired him to help with the dress on the carpet and he was just doing his job If she felt like he was being too attentive she could have just said something like I can take it from here thank you

 Completely agree Parts of America caught in a tizzy do need to calm down Shes just encouraging we educate ourselves and vote with candidates aligned with policies and values important to us I like she celebrates everyone Let us have someone we can respect and find inspiring in her Cross generational music and lyrics that connect to many peoples experience The way she treats people around her sounds quite positive

 L album of the year
 I know some people dont think Midnights is her best album but I believe Taylor acquired more fans through this album Her popularity only grew because of it with the Eras tour and tour movie The other artists who didnt win SZA and Olivia should still be around Olivia in my opinion is still young I really hop SZA is around to stay as well The one I do feel bad for is Lana because shes an amazing artist and has been working hard for years Shes so talented and I believe thats why Taylor brought her up on stage and recognized her Her first AOTY was in 2010thats 14 years ago How many artists can stay that relevant for those many years especially a woman Yes these awards are subjective and the artists know it Theres actually many artists who dont care about the awards but like JayZ said they still watch it But to be rewarded by this achievement love her or hate her its quite incredible
 Im just glad Reagans dead
 AOTY for Midnights was a guarantee Tbh I love The fact that she got 2 awards lovely

 Have you seen the clip of how they made the song what was I made for By Billy Eilish and Finneas Really interesting how so many subtle additions gave the song depth I wondered how did they produce it to sound d like shes quietly singing to just me in my ear The answer triple tracks on the music where her voice is overlaid exactly even while maintaining jazzy adjustments Much came from her held back almost falsetto and the very quiet instruments in the background Ad libbed bits created personality All the songs were worthy of a win I have to say this song really gave me chills It really acknowledged what it can feel like to be a woman holding it together but in existential despair
 First artist to ever win Album of the Year four times actually insane Congrats Taylor
 Hoping when I wake up I will see more praise instead of hate Instead of people talking about the major record breaking moment she's being bashed because people hate to see success The only person to EVER win 4 album of the years at the Grammys

 Seeing the butt hurt ppl in the pop culture chat is just
 I hope she hires a speech writer She breaks the record and don't have a speech ready She going into directing next year golden globes  Emmys  sag awards look for memorable speeches and the one with memorable speeches get Oscar nominations etcthats how America Ferriera got an Oscar nomination for Barbie Just she becoming a bigger star She need to expand beside her family handling everything
 I loved midnights I was in a relationship when it was first released and then went through a breakup late last year The albums meaning changed for me through both of those phases I couldnt listen to sweet nothing anymore but bejeweled became my anthem Ive now met someone new and songs like glitch and labyrinth have a whole new meaning to me This is a truly no skip album to me I can put it on shuffle and be impressed with any song Im so incredibly proud of her and grateful to have had it released for this time in my life I didnt think it was gonna win This is the first aoty I didnt see televised as I was on a plane but I am so so so indebted to this album and all versions
 I'm SO happy for Taylor and definitely felt like she deserved to win And I'm equally and probably more excited for TS11 But I thought Taylor's behavior tonight was off The Celine incident bringing Lana on stage announcing her album at the Grammys even giving Jack the noogie felt immature Like a one off of these things isn't a big deal but it just felt off Idk Like yes she took the photo back stage and it was a big moment for her and she wanted to celebrate with Lana etc I feel weird calling it out but it was awkward to watch
 The drama I want in on is WHAT DID SHE YELL from the stage Please get the lip readers on it ASAP I can't do it I've got a job
 I find it funny that no one can even agree on who was snubbed This isnt like certain previous years when there was a clear front runner and it was shocking when they didnt win Personally I thought that Taylor SZA Lana and Olivia had about roughly even odds of winning with maybe a slight edge towards Taylor because the eras tour has been so culturally dominant and even though the Grammys shouldnt be taking that into account theres definitely some voters who do

 I see that the AI crazy people commenter bots are out in force now I mean the trolls It's like it's a bot though with the tired ways of trying to repeat salacious things in order to get attention Like cut and paste Honestly I'm just so tired of the hate It's so boring and equally depressing that even in a TS sub we can't just enjoy the fun and the excitement of wins and new albums but have to read hate and criticism every other comment I don't understand the people who gleefully look for things to hate on This girl was the USA's entertainment industry's main powerhouse this year If the girl wanted to announce that she was going to buy the moon wethey should have all clapped and asked her if she was going to develop a Taylor Swift theme park I mean honestly people She most certainly deserved the win I'm not even a swiftie But this woman is an intelligent talented powerhouse I know this and I'm just a passing fan and a hater of bullying and demeaning verbal abuse

 Im still annoyed at the Travis Scott performance lol
 I have watched it several times and I do agree she could have made eye contact with Celine while accepting the award It was a big deal for Celine to even be there and it was quite rude for Taylor not to acknowledge her
 Midnights is Taylors second best album Folklore of course is best There i have countered all the feelings hurt lana and sza olivia fans
 Is she headed on the plane already I need a postceremony photoshoot with 13 and 14 trophies
 IM SORRY I DONT LIKE THE NEW ALBUM COVER I WISH SHE CHOSE ANOTHER BampW PIC FROM THAT COLLECTION
