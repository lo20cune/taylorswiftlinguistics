 Random prediction if Travis proposes to her sometime before the tour is over she will change the lyrics to Karma is the guy on the Chiefs getting down on one knee
 Come join us in the June  megathread
 I think were going to get another TTPD music vid either in Lyon or at the beginning of the London shows and then we get some sort of rerecord announcement at the end of the London shows  maybe even Liverpool we get the announcement instead
 This thread is so dry yall I really hope we get the other 2 rerecords this year Im fully on board the September 13th and December 13th train Wonder if she will announce rep tv in June What yall think

 Random shower theory TS12 will be called Sagittarius and will have an astrology aesthetic 12th album  12 star signs well technically 13 but ya know12 main ones It will be released at the start of Sag season circa Nov 22 terrible time to release so close to Christmas I know  but at this rate TS will succeed regardless of when she drops music I feel like we've had some Sagittarius teasing already which could just be Tay embracing her star sign  constellation during the Midnights era but then again nothing is accidental I'm also convinced that TS13 will be called 13 stylised as XIII imgemotet5_2rlwe1081 Edit not this year just whatever year it is released  OMG I was just thinking maybe for 2026 13 x 2 26
 BIG DEPUTATION Those Suprise Songs were wild I have a feeling the next few weeks of shows are going to be MASSIVE
 My clown detector has not been detecting much this month but it has a ping on the June London shows
 An update to my post yesterday the monkey has been hinted at for a third time
 Is it just me or is Taylor nation being way more active and sus than normal I mean I know they are always active and sus during the shows but today seems different lol
 She hasnt been to Madrid in 13 YEARS
 
 please taylor do something unhinged as an early birthday present XD i'm praying for the most outrageous mashups tonight
 GUYS ITS A CLOCK Edit I meant the year is clock my bad guys
 Haven't seen anyone post this yet It's from the But Daddy I Love Him Acoustic Version CD That must mean something's happeningreleasing on September 13th right Sorry if it's already been posted and old news
 This is the second time they referenced the monkey toy I believe  Maybe theyre Easter egging a mv or something
 Are we clowning for a Wednesday announcement today
 Wonder if Taylor has anything up her sleeve tonight Also off topic but finally got a signed TTPD cd
 I think ICDIWABH samples Here Comes The Rain Again by Annie Lennox which definitely gives me a different perspective on ICDIWABH Especially the here comes the rain again suggesting performing with a heartbreak is what Taylor is used to
 This isnt exactly a theory more of an invisible string but I find it too special for me not to share  The Chronicles of Narnia film is one of my favorites but the music from the first film especially was absolutely magical and honestly reinforced the way I view life and the world to this day And I just found out that that soundtrack was releasedon December 13th 2005 Not just Taylors birthday but the year I believe she started working on her debut album I know its perhaps not such a big deal in the grand scheme of things But Taylors music means just as much to me as the Narnia soundtrack so finding this out has made me so happy beyond my wildest dreams
 I have a feeling Taylor will do something similar to what she did with the Karma MV where she will announce something and a couple months later come back to TTPD and release a new music video
 Music Video theory based on Tour visuals Down Bad music video will pick up where Fortnight left off

 Ok whats the tea wheres the MV Is there gonna be a second MV I just need one reason to clown
 We have a  in her new post
 Seeing the London fanfare has me clowning more for an announcement Probably for the last August show
 BENSON BOONE OPENING THE ERAS TOUR IN LONDON EDIT looks like Griff is there too
 Does anyone else think that the piano in Chloe et al is intentionally meant to mimic the little piano riff at the very end of Champagne Problems It's so specific and odd that it has to be a tie to it
 Have had the same flair for months but wise men once read fake news and they believed it is worthy of a change
 With Taylor and Taylor Nations most recent posts Im really starting to question the length of these album cycles It used to be so simple being a swiftie
 what does the back cover of the BDILH acoustic cd look like
 Not sure if someone has asked this yet is there a reason next weeks shows are Wed Thur instead of the weekend Is it something simple like stadium availability or am I a clown
 Taylornation saying something about changing back profile picture
 Its official Ive left my  in Lisbon Is this her way of saying that we are moving out of the TTPD era Not bringing this up to be like YES I WANT REP TV but I am bringing it up because it did peak my interest and makes me wonder if we are moving out of this era so quickly I never can tell with her
 Y'all I think this week has made it abundantly clear that Taylor loves being on top and as she should so there's no way she's gonna drop Debut TV and rep tv at the same time They can't both go to 1 and Debut is her only album to not reach 1 so it just doesn't make sense to let rep tv overshadow it Can we please put those theories to rest now The Debutation jokes however are really funny and should never be put to rest
 I just watched the eras tour movie for the first time and in the end credits there is this thank you to the fans In between the last letter and the green heart there are 13 and 12 beads  debut TV on 13th of December
 After the secret song choices today gtttdp x now that we dont talklt I think we can safely say that shes just mixing and matching muses and having fun singing her songs however she sees fit except the ones she clearly dedicating to Travis
 How do we feel about her reputation bodysuit shedding like a snake
 TTPD Anthology has 3 songs that starts with a lowercase letter lomlimgonnagetyoubackthanK you aIMee Track 121824 Both are 6 songs between each other reputation is the 6th album
 Red herring is becoming a SUPER common theme this year

 Today its snakes taken from XTwitter I love it

 So I just saw this article this is a new theory to me and doesnt quite add up anyone else see this or can verify anything
 Kinda random thought when folklore came out hoax always perplexed me because I just knew there was no way that song was fictional Just relistened to it and my heart is shattered now  I think that song easily could have been on anthology and further tells me that a lot of Anthology songs were most likely written around or right near folkloreevermore times and were stashed away
 All the old tours merch is on saleIm still sticking to my theory
 Her outfit is very little mermaid codedbut daddy I love him video in coming jk sorta
 Any clowns clowning for a MV today Just cuz
 Apparently the floor bracelets at the show are green with butterflies on themand TN made this comment
 This era is really slowing down for me No music videos except Fortnight no Easter egg hunting post launch I understand shes on the eras tour but at least she was a little more active during Midnights
 Ok but how iconic would it be if The Anthology got 4 variants with 4 bonus tracks and then 15 more songs came out
 These one off CDs are giving me Willow flashbacks
