 Is there a post somewhere these of the statistics all in one place Like surprise song statistics Outfit choice statistics How many times she's made announcements or releases for each month What I'm asking is there like a statistics megathread for the nerds like me that want to see all that
 Sharing my album tier list here since auto moderator removed my post and the mods haven't approved it and the message I received said if I asked about it they wouldn't approve it lol
 Not me watching the eras tour for the 3rd time this weekend I think Im having withdrawals
 Could anyone who has done the Swift Alert brackets before help me out what does seeded mean And also am I supposed to be able to see the brackets cause I can only se the picture in too bad res to read anything imgemotet5_2rlwe1063
 Idk where else to say this but I need to get it out  if Tay had cancelled a big show in Europe two days before to rehearse and perform at the VMAs shed be called the devil  and this is coming from a huge fan of the artist in question
 I accidently clicked on a snark sub post omg why are people so mean Like It hurts my heart that people have so much hate
 This article from marca is the dumbest click bait ever and worthless I'm posting about it as I hope no one else is as dumb as me to click on the article ltltKansas City Chiefs Travis Kelce can't live up to Taylor Swift's impossible standards as mic'd up video reveals his strugglegtgt
 Hello i created a tiktok account for daily song recommendations Lyric videos with animations Can you recommend a taylor swift song and its specific part that would go hard on this
 You know whats poetic Driving back home when out of nowhere it starts POURING rain and now your car and the cars around you are sloshing water everywhere as you just happen to be listening to Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die I dont belong and my beloved neither do you
 Oasis fans will soon learn what we've learned about TM
 Any tips for people who have bought tickets secondhand I'm hoping to still go but I don't have 2000 to spend on seats behind the stage lol
 Anyone else getting involved with the Swifties4Kamala group
 Hi all Wondering how many people here have tried the travel to venue without tickets get last minute tickets method I know generally this has worked for me in the past but the demand for The Eras Tour surpasses anything I've attempted to get tickets for in the past I can imagine a lot of people outside the stadium trying this same method so I'm wondering how many people it actually works for Considering making a drive and shooting my shot in Indianapolis even if I miss the first song or two I'd be happy Any thoughtsexperienceadvice
 I need a new hobby something to think about Usually her tour and the threads do the trick but shes on break I play Sims 4 and Stardew Valley I try to read I go to the gym 4x a week What else can I do preferably from a desk when I am bored at work lol
 Hey everyone I was just doing some research on Eras tour ticket prices How much did you pay for it seat location venue ie any information is appreciated Would love to find some tickets for sale but Im tired of the scalpers and scammers Im not looking to buy tickets on this thread Thanks
 Its so funny that Grand Theft Auto is now canonically a Taylor Swift lyric
 A bit tangential but just listened to an old interview Aaron Dessner  Aaron starts around the 55 minute mark
 Instagram notifications are so delayed I JUST got the notification of the end of Europe post from yesterday Do you have a different way that you are notified
 I just wanted to say this and unfortunately the thread about her post is locked so My heart truly goes out to her she was in such a difficult and terrifying position and while I completely empathize with the devastation of shows being cancelled having people assume the worst of her and that she didnt care had to have made that guilt and grief even more intense As everyone has said her care and love for her fans is an absolutely unwavering pillar of her career she deserved respect and time to express this safely after everything shes given us for nearly twenty years Shes a fallible human of course but one thing I never doubt is her appreciation for the fans I too am thankful that everyone was grieving concerts and not lives any time something horrific like this is thwarted its a miracle She made a beautiful and gracious statement I hope she gets some well deserved rest over this break Her music gives us so much solace and joy and I also hope she feels that radiated back Its a gift to have that and may we hold it close forevermore
 If Taylor did support Trump would all the Swifties vote for Trump too
 Does the store or merch stands ever have youth sizes My 6 yo wants some merch but I'm thinking I will have to find something online
 Happy Shake It Off anniversary
 We wish Taylor had done an Evermore Long Pond Version but maybe we should do it ourselves Those of us who are musically inclined can assemble a pianist guitarist and vocalist and perform and share our own runthroughs of Evermore And its just a thing that we have hundreds of Evermore Swifties Versions on the Internet Man this thought is like 35 years late
 Non Taylor Swift fan here I just had a few questions Are you guys really as deranged as the internet makes you out to be or is this just the loud minority What music other than Taylor Swift do you like What songs do you recommend for introducing someone to Taylor Swift Thank you to anyone who answers this
 really feeling when emma falls in love rn
 Okay random question I want to find a similar sequin set that Taylor wears during TTPD set on the tour What do I search for to find it Its an important part of a sexy George Washington Halloween costume
 i need help finding the song the humming in the bg is from at 630 to 635  Is it epiphany or am I losing my mind edit I have no clue if this is allowed I saw general discussion and decided to come here
 are Stubhub tickets typically repersonalized after buying
 Can anyone confirm how ticket trades work Id like to trade my Toronto tickets for Vancouver tickets since we have family in Vancouver we could stay with but Im not sure the best way to go about it
 Do we think Taylor is superstitious enough to avoid the Warsaw wrapup until she has something else to post She currently has 665 posts
 Man I feel very dumb Taylor is playing London so late to avoid conflict with the Olympics
 Was listening to Flume by Bon Ivor never noticed the lyric Only love is all maroon Lapping lakes like leery loons Leaving rope burns Reddish rouge Feel like Maroon and this song are intertwined in my head now
 YouTube just recommended me the Live From Paris edition of My Boy Only Breaks His Favourite Toys and it just made me realise that there's more versions and more promo for this song than there is for I Can Do It With A Broken Heart the actual single
 Hello has anyone ever bought a ticket on Fansale I keep getting the message this ticket cannot currently be purchased Should I just keep solving Captchas and trying or is it pointless because the ticket is already gone
 Taylor Swift needs to tell everyone to back up back up mind your business that's all just mind your business
 WAIT WAIT WAIT in the chorus of Question there are ahhhhh ohhhs ahhhh and it sounds like the out of woods background vocals I know the I remember in the beginning refers to OOTW but I never knew about these either and it hit me as im listening to it now
 Just thinking how the narrative for haters used to be She doesn't even write her own music it's too good but now its Well she doesn't even write good music lol I listened to another artist I like and he took a shot at the singersongwriter thing and it justwasn't good It was boring and told more than it showed Taylor is just on another level You don't have to like her music just like you don't have to like certain poetry or books But it doesn't mean it's not good
 GET IN THE CAR ITS AUGUST
 Hopeful request for any picturesvideos from Denver Night 2 that may include my husband and I  We were in 2nd row in section N right by the diamond I have a purple bob and am wearing a purplepink sequin romper my husband's wearing a teal shirt  Thank you for your help
 Hi everyone I how this reaches as many swifties as possible I am currently a contender for a scholarship that focuses on introducing more young teenage girls to careers in STEM and pushes them to major in maths and science It also really focuses on empowering women So I was asked to prepare a short activity where I talk about an influential woman and I could talk about someone that is really old and maybe invented something revolutionary 50 years ago but when it comes to teens and their skibidi interests I wanted to talk about someone they all probably know but most dont know did so much for the world wink wink Now you probably understand that I want to talk about Taylor So help me out I know that after Taylor spoke about the election in the US the vote rates went up and Im sure that is only one example
 What social media channels  apps does everyone use to stay in touch with updates about Taylor and the universe surrounding her I was holding on to x just for a couple fan accounts but I'm genuinely tired of it and of the Disney villain running it so I'd love some alternatives but ig is kinda dispersive '
 Some lovely girls have set up a fundraiser going directly to alder hay charity after the horrific attacks today Please consider donating if you have the means  link wont post but see Metsswift on X for the page
 Does anyone know if the Taylor swift Spotify mural is still up in Los Angeles
 Does anyone know if I can change the batteries in my light up batonglow stick from the movie theater Tia
 Does anyone know what the higher pitch of love story is called the only bit I can remember is like Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone but instead a higher pitch and slowed Or is this just the Elvira remix
 Why are we not talking about this announcement of a live performance of Are You Ready for It  8PM
 Am I the only one who sees the vision of Taylor playing change at the last eras tours show when all the rerecordings hopefully have been released Like to me it makes so much sense but like I keep seeing so many saying they would love to hear it soon But like imagine all the rerecordings have been released and Taylor sings it was the night things changed can you see it now When the walls that they put up to holds us back fell down its a revolution throw your hands up cause we never gave in
 Good god the fuxmoi people are exhausting I follow that sub for gossip but every single headline about anyone at all the first comment is always a snarky comment about Taylor I get not liking her and holding her accountable cause heaven knows she's far from perfect but oh my god It's insane how much they love talking about her while hating her
 KARMA IS MY BOYFRIEND
 Did anyone hear the podcast when it first aired What was your response
 deleted
 Today I had eye surgery pretty intense eye muscle surgery not lasik and as I was being wheeled into the OR Delicate was on and then okay this is gold I Can See You was next After that I heard Shake It Off then I was fully under but I am guessing my surgeon gets to pick the songs and that she is a Swiftie I had some bad experiences with a med student leading up to being wheeled into the OR and having Taylor playing made me so calm
 Not exactly related to Taylor but I felt like this should be shared Last night I went to a swing dance event for the first time in quite a while During the day I was feeling a bit tired and blue and I almost decided not to go But then I told myself that was the very reason I should go that dancing to a genre of music I love and being surrounded by good people was just what I needed to feel better Well when I got there I had to sign in with my name and I realized My name was number 13 on the list
 Fortnight is a huge grower I never disliked it but it was kind of a nothing for me when I first heard it It had some good lines but nothing crazy It got in my head again and I feel like reading the lyrics on Spotify helped me appreciate it too For one I didn't understand all of the lyrics it sounded to me like your wife bought her flowers as opposed to your wife waters flowers but the line structure is also unique in that there's rests within a line but sometimes not a rest separating lines Without knowing where one ends and another begins the story doesn't make as much sense or at least doesn't flow Post's  refrain before the outro makes more sense reading the lyrics as well Won't be my favorite off TTPD or anything but a good song
 Will there be a eras tour 2 or something like that in the future I didn't get any tickets this time and would love to see her perform the older songscurrent songs Now I am worried that she will be only playing newer songs at future tours
 I was playing the online game what beats rock where essentially you keep on saying something that would beat the last thing you said and the game essentially says if it would or wouldnt I was the first one to say this LMAO
 Curious Would anyone be interested for a TTPD signed CD and vinyl for 3 Eras Indy tickets can be upper bowl but not obstructed lower bowl preferred and would pay some cash for it or would that not be a fair trade
 What would you do if you broke your ankle the month before an international trip to see the Eras tour By a stroke of luck last summer I was able to purchase face value tickets for one of the shows at Wembley in August I think we spent around 800 USD total on 2 tickets The All Too Well package My fiancé and I planned a 2 week trip for EnglandScotland and have been looking forward to it He's actually a bigger Swiftie than I am and has never been to Europe so we were both excited 2 weeks ago I slipped and fell at home which I frequently do as I am very clumsy but this one was a bit of a freak accident and I broke my tibia fibula and dislocated my ankle I had surgery 5 days ago and am the proud owner of some plates and screws holding me together My first question for the surgeon was about our trip and he said he's okay with me flying if I'm okay not walking while I'm there as I won't be cleared to put weight on it until end of August I am a huge walker and love to get 20k steps a day on vacations so the idea of flying over there for 2 weeks and having to navigate London on crutchesscooterwheelchair bums me out I try to make the best of what I'm given but no denying that I'd be sad about it We looked on SeatGeek at some of the North America shows and saw single tickets starting at 1600 so that's out of the question One of my friends went to Wembley in June and said it was amazing wonderful and if all I do is fly there and see the show it'll be worth it I don't think going there JUST for the concert is worth the travel hassle but we're exploring options and I just wanted some strangers to weigh in on my life because my next appt with my therapist isn't for a few weeks These are the options I've come up with A Cancel the flighthotel both are refundable and sell the tickets It's one of the VIP packages with merch so if I'm not there in person I believe no one else can pick up the merch so that's a waste We'd reschedule the trip for springsummer next year when I'm fully healed The night of the concert we get a nice bottle of champagne and watch the tour movie at home neither of us have seen it yet B Go for the original trip and just take a knee scooter and maybe crutches too and do our best to find tube stations with elevators and accept that this isn't the trip we planned but make lemonade out of these lemons anyway C Reschedule our flights to go to the concert and spend a few days in London doing some lowmovement activities then plan to go back next springsummer for our original 2 week trip and call it our honeymoon we're getting married in the spring This feels like a very bougie option but financially wouldn't hurt us I have enough credit card points to pay for another flight so the finances aren't a big factor it's more so whether it'll be 'worth' the jet lag to have such a short trip If you made it this far sincerely thank you I've probably rambled but being stuck on the couch for 2 weeks straight does funny things to the brain Are there any factors I'm not thinking about What would you do
 Random question but does anyone know about taylors pinterest leaking in 2023 Saw it on a tiktok comment
 Does anybody know if there's any HD recording of the whole TTPD set somewhere on YouTube I've been avoiding every video like the plague before I got to saw it live in Milan but now that I have i just wanna rewatch it ten times a day for the rest of my life 
 Do you think TK makes the trip back to Europe for one more show to make it lucky number 13 He has training camp starting Friday Not that it matters because I didn't know you were keeping count but she did make 13 of his games
 I have had some random revelations about the tortured poets department song that I haven't seen others post  I was inspired by seeing someone say they thought Harry Styles was the tattooed golden retriever Then I thought what if this song is about the collective of artsy boys that she's dated and how she feels dating this TYPE How they are always all in and start love bombing writing songs because that is who these men think they are  and she's trying to say she's always the one to bring them all down to earth by saying you're not Dylan Thomas and I'm not Patti Smith we aren't these people we aren't as cool and artsy as you want to believe we are And they always tell her that she is the only one who knows them like that So this song is about this pattern of men which is why it's the department  and then I would say that this whole album is about this pattern she has put herself in with dating I also had one other thought about the alchemy  I have seen people say it's about Matty bc she mentions blokes and heroine  but after a couple of listens I really think its about Travis making fun of Matty to make her feel better Like she was probably letting him know about the issues with his drug use and he jokes oh yeah it's heroine for me but it's actually you that's my heroine And he tells her he's now just a bloke warming the benches Which makes me kind of like the song lmao
 Guys I've been thinking about how wild it will be when Taylor finally does like a proper sit down interview that's not on paper like it's been so long She hasn't done one since before the eras tour and and since then SO much has happened and she has literally become the most famous person on earth according to time Like imagine how many views an interview on Fallon would get at this point like it's actually insane to think about It will probably first be after the eras tour has ended but by then imagine how many things the interviewer would have to cover Times person of the year album of the year at the Grammys the eras tour the re recordings ttpd and they'll probably also ask her about the nfl stuff
 Anyone know how I can sell my ticket on fanSALE if my barcode hasn't loaded yet
 For people who have already exchangedswapped tickets in the UK and Europe how did you do it safely I'm trying go swap my ticket for another but I'm scared I'll be conned Did you use an app Did you successfully swap or were you scammed Any info useful Thanks

 do y'all think taylor is gonna do anything for the 5th anniversary of lover i doubt she would release anything on august 23rd bc sabrina's new album drops that day I'm secretly hoping for a reissue w all of the girls and need maybe the live from paris songs too
 Did we ever get the results for the subs poll on TTPDs tracklist
 Ive always loved Taylors music but Im a relatively new Swiftie Ive been following the Eras tour I noticed all of her shoes are red bottomed Please dont think this is a stupid question but are they actual red bottoms As in Louboutins Are they custom made Are they a different shade of red than the iconic red bottoms maybe more along the lines of her signature red lip Im so curious
 I'm ashamed at how much I need a TnT post from either which says after the storm something was born on the 8th of July
 Did you guys see Ryan Reynolds instagram story DeadpoolTaylor mashup shes got to be in it or they are just messing with us at this point

 Going to the Zurich show with the Never go out of Style VIP package  Anyone know if it is sitting or standing At the time I bought iit said it was seated but the tickets seem to say standing and we have no seat number
 Anyone else have a specific part of a Taylor song that just scratches all the itches in their brain like mine currently is up on the roof with a school girl crushhh drinking beer out of plastic cupss I know its the way she drags out those two words but something about it just scratches my brain but it changes all the time
 anyone else ever attempt to listen to lover straight through and end up failing because they just listen to cruel summer on repeat or is it just me
 Songs from TTPD I have not listened to since release week TTPD loml the alchemy the manuscript I've listened to thank you aimee and bdilh a few times since release week but those aren't really rotation either Funny thing is that Spotify keeps suggesting all these songs for the TTPD playlist I made I left them out on purpose Spotify GEEZ

 What political Taylor songs could she play in Indianapolis in November this year the few days before the US general election Change I will sob Only the Young
 On todays episode of Misheard Lyrics WHY did all this time I thought in I Can Do It With A Broken Heart she sings I cry and laugh but I am so productivewhen its actually cry a lot and the correct line even makes more sense
 I just watched the Taylor Swift vs Scooter Braun Bad Blood documentary on Max I don't really think the documentary did a good job of telling Taylors side of the story I was basically a retelling of what we have already heard but I feel that it failed to really make the point of why Taylor so opposed specifically Scott owning her music There were only some universal mentions at best The other episode that focused on Scooter Brauns point of view came across as poor little rich guy getting criticized for what is a perfectly legal business deal and how Taylor sent her fans after him for it They also make it seem like Taylor had every opportunity to get the rights to her music but that episode does not mention the criteria attached to those offers which the Taylor episode at least mentions One thing I haven't really understood in the whole mess is how the focus always seems to be on Scooter Braun rather than Scott Borchetta Or do you feel that Scott Borchetta is also getting well deserved backlash for his part I understand Taylor not wanting Scooter to own her legacy but that to me is just water being wet The real betrayal in my eyes is Scott Borchetta deciding to sell his company to Scooter of all people knowing how Taylor would feel about it If it was me I would be far more angry at Scott in this whole situation Has there ever been any explanation from Scott why he had to sell to Scooter of all people Surely when a deal with Taylor couldn't be made there must have been lots and lots of other potential buyers out there Did Scott sell to Taylor is a punishment for her not signing a new deal with Big Machine If that's the case then I reiterate once again that Scott is the real villain and the documentary should be called Taylor Swift vs Scott Borchetta I feel he might have gotten away with murder in this whole deal
 Me watching yet another reaction video to TTPD cause why not D before the reactor starts each song Oh no I dont think Im ready for this one at all Homies Ive already listened to this album a tredecillion times and know these damn songs like the back of my handand I still feel like Im listening to them all for the first time
 us feat Taylor is super cute and everything I wanted from a Taylor and Gracie collab
 Hello i was just gonna post a question but i was also going to say hi and introduced myself a bit not going to go full emotional promise First the question How many different songs did she played acoustically on Eras Tour I mean counting just the two surprise songs she does every show how many did she played Cos there must be a big number by now and I don't know if any other pop artist have played that many songs like that I mean a song's gotta have a certain level of quality both melodically and composition wise to support itself with just vocals and one instrument This comes from someone who's been making a living for over 20 years now composing playing and producing music but I've around even more before making some bucks So I'm no teen  I'm a dude btw I'm sorry if this was discussed before I'm kinda new here and i really like the vibe of this subreddit I've replied some messages here and there but never introduced myself before not that's necessary i guess i just so you know in case I say something dumb cos although I've been listening to Taylor's music since Red came out and I truly loved 1989 I never considered myself a Swifty although Shake It Off was my 1 Song of the Year from 2014 and I feel like I'm becoming one since JanuaryFebruary this year So there's a lot I don't know about her I just love her music amp lyrics I've been terribly thankfully busy with work so i didn't had time to really listen properly Folklore Evermore and Midnight until last year where i took a sabbatical from work and I couldn't believe it when I heard those records she went to a whole another level Midnight was the first I picked to listen cos it was the more recent one and it blew my mind Sonically first Lavender Haze was like what is going on here that sounds not only more mature but is a really freaking great production It sound amazing That kick alone pure love Everything except a couple of hits is very subtle Then I started paying attention to the lyrics that was when my brain made a click You Are On You're Own Kid really touch something inside me cos even not being a super star woman we can all relate to that feeling And after my mother died idk it almost made me cried And just minutes later that was the one Question i was like shit I'm done I don't wanna bore you with what I felt with that song but it was special The other two were even more unexpected cos i only new well Cardigan and Willow Wow I was fascinated with how much her sonic palette had grown and lyrically totally speechless Gladly I was already in for the ride for April 19th and I just cannot stop listening TTPD Is like almost everyday I find something new that I love about it So yep I'm a full grown man not turning into a Swifty whatever that may be but I'm totally in already having deep conversations about her music with other producers and friends who still don't give this woman the credits she really deserves Anyway Hope to get some answers so I can have even more tools when conversations arise PS sorry in advance for my English is not my primary language
 Im excited that I placed a bid for a TTPDBDILH Acoustic CD I hope Im able to win it But I feel like if I actually get it I wont be able to play it bc its so special lol
