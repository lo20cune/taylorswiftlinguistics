 Hi fellow clowns Here is the link to our new September thread
 August has in fact slipped away into a moment in time
 Whats everyones theories as to why Taylor mashed up Getaway car x August x TOSOTD As a Melbourne n2 swiftie Ive been wondering why August was in there since it was already on the set list Many people thought it could mean a Rep release but obviously that didnt happen lol
 The biggest troll of 2024 Taylor performing IDSB and NOT announcing rep TV
 I dont think Ill ever get tired of loml Beautifully devastating listen to it every day sometimes the first thing I listen to when I wake up

 From a charting perspective without a major intervention like Anthology physicals or signed CDs TTPDs run at the top is probably finished Its currently selling 60k album units Chapelle is at around 74k week over week Post Malone will have at least a few more weeks over 60k Same with Sabrina and maybe Travis Scott And that stupid Morgan Wallen album is still stable at around 60k album units primarily from streaming That doesnt even take in account other new albums that can get a week at 100k So it isnt unreasonable to think the announcement will come soon We clearly had a lot of Reputation TV clues during tail end of tour Why didnt she announce then It could be because Sabrina was releasing that Friday and Taylor wanted to give her the moment Might have been a little too early as well for a 225 month rollout if the release is 118 between US and Toronto or 1129 between Toronto and Vancouver Ill be perched for the VMAs She also could mimic the original rollout and just drop the announcement on social media although I dont expect her to wipe her social media beforehand It would be hilariously effective if she did a Rally for Kamala and announced Rep TV at that rally Every time the press talked about the announcement theyd talk about Reputation TV and vice versa for Kamala Lol That would likely generate too much heat so I dont see it happening but its a funny thought
 In hindsight I think Taylors quiet period for almost eight full months in 2022 was one of her smartest moves ever Even though weve been gifted so much music within the past 5 years that was an odd window of time Red Taylors Version was such a big moment and then nine months later Midnights was announced I still think about that
 I'm not clowning for anything yet BUT I do want to point out that the last 1989 combo Taylor wore in London was pinkyellow and those are the colours used in all the marketing for this year's VMAs Taylor Nation has now posted a highly suspicious VMA post on their Instagram not just a story telling us to all go vote If something were to come at the VMAs and this is FAR from certain these are the types of Easter Eggs we saw ahead of the Midnights and TTPD announcements at awards shows If the teasing ramps up second week of September get ready to put that clown makeup back on
 AAP Rocky is releasing a single at midnight called Tailor Swif Whaaaaat
 I'm not saying it's real because insiders have lied before but let's say this Charli XCX collab is real When do y'all think it would be announced
 I just had a wild idea  what if when they came back from this break as a surprise she throws in a couple mashups to give debut her moment as part of the eras tour I can see her bringing back the should've said no  bad blood from rep or I could see her extending speak now again and our song  sparks fly
 Just a reminder that Taylor once said she was excited about going back and giving music videos to songs fan wanted them for originally  which weve seen isnt the standard but it means we could get a Getaway Car MV
 After the major clowning of August 20 it made me think when would the next tvs come out About a bit more than 6 months after midnights came out she announced speak now tv and what is more than 6 months after ttpd release November December I think rep tv will be announced at the very end of the tour Now about debut tv Notice how every single era got a part in the eras tour except debut I think debut will get its own time to shine after the eras tour
 Did anyone catch that the last tiktok bead switched from being called Debut to SelfTitled instead I dont have any further theories as to what that actually means But its weird to switch two days before the last challenge starts
 The internet is abuzz this morning that there might be a forthcoming TaylorCharli XCX collab  either a remix of Sympathy is a Knife or a possible feature on a future track like a vault track perhaps Taylor was quoted in a recent Charli XCX feature article which is I believe what started the rumours Thoughts
 Can anyone confirm because I am confused Is rep green or orange Ive been so confused because I thought debut was green but then theres all these Easter eggs with green lights for rep
 I miss the Eras Tour already Those livestream threads were so much fun and this past weekend wasnt the same without it  Anyway since this is the theories thread  are we clowning for anything for Miami N1 I feel like Miami N1 and Vancouver N3 are the dates that make the most sense for Something to happen
 Her hanging out with Brittany Mahomes after she was discovered to be a huge Trumpie is Taylor's attempt at being cancelled so Reputation TV will hit harder For the protocol this is not an actual theory it's a joke Haha

 I still think something is happening on September 13th
 Ive basically given up on clowning entirely but I do think its worth mentioning that she released a new album in April this year instead of the fall
 I feel like the last leg of the tour is going to be unhinged when it comes to announcementssurprises Guest appearances new outfits the last two TVs possibly TS12 Anyone good with the numbers and dates have ideas on which shows we should be paying attention to other than obviously the last show Hoping to snag last minute tickets to one of the US shows
 More of a hindsight invisible string but I came across this old clip of an Ed Sheeran interview from SiriusXM where he already mentioned his and Taylors tour dates happening on the same daysexcept for a block of days next year He also quite strongly emphasized that he had not rerecorded End Game yet lol redirecting the attention to the then upcoming 1989 TV  But then I realized the clip was released on YouTube Shorts August 16th 2023 And guess what happened nearexactly one year later  And what song did Ed and Taylor performONE YEAR later Masterminds indeed
 Does anyone have any thoughts on why the Debut bead on the TikTok challenge is the only one that is available for two weeks set to end on September 12 All the other ones were available only for one week each I'm still a September 13 believer but I don't know why

 What are the odds of long live coming back to the setlist before the end of tour I just refuse to give up imgemotet5_2rlwe32929 And I know theyre close to none
 To me including this image in the ICDWBH video might be a hint that Rep will be the final rerecord released The empty closets ie all her past selves have been freed when Rep is on stage
 Currently watching Miss Americana  I just watched the making of Getaway Car clip and it made me think maybe them reenacting it in London was an Easter egg about the Eras documentary that seems to be incoming It was cute regardless lol but it could also be a hint
 Does anyone have a list of all the artists she's been seen with at Electric Lady I'm trying to see something
 In case anyone was wondering Taylor Swift nor Beyonc√© were at the DNC
 She will sing Change at the Democratic National Convention
 Rumors of Taylor and Travis being at the DNC TMZ leaked Beyonce and apparently Taylor might be there too This will be a crazy night either way Edit  Gayle King also talked about Travis possibly going
 I was just relistening to Question and now with TTPD I think it's obvious it's about Matty I feel like this has been tossed around some but I haven't seen it discussed that much I wonder specifically if the line about being in a crowded room making fun etc refers to how he was probably judged for being associated with Taylor then went on to say in the media that he'd be emasculated if he ever dated her The lyrics of asking do you wish you could still hold her also parallel a lot of the what if amp idealism in TTPD Also we had one thing going onI swear it was somethingbefore you painted all my nights a color I've searched for since relates to I look in people's windows Again with the missed opportunity idealism wondering what could've been Also the lyric but you were on something is the same as Chloe Sam You turned me into an idea of sorts  You needed me but you needed drugs more Edit to add Someone reminded me below that she played Question on tour around the time she was likely dating Matty and said it reminded her of happy memories
 It will not be Taylor at the DNC tonight It's too risky for everyone in the room and I think her experience in Vienna is going to temper her speaking up this election which is disappointing but is what it is
 honestly wouldn't be surprised if we get TS12 by the end of this year At the latest summer 2025 which is less than a year away by this point its color will be orange Poppy summery happy Maybe some 60s70s orange flowers Would love some moody outlaw acoustic songs ala No Body No Crime and Carolina
 There's rumors circulating Twitter about a mega surprise guest for the last night of the DNC today and so many people are guessing it's Taylor I'm pretty sure it won't be her and seeing all the excitement is stressing me out because I feel like it's just another thing people will be mad at her for if she doesn't show  I think deadline or something said earlier this week she wasn't going because it would potentially overshadow Kamala her power omg I'm very confident we'll get an endorsement eventually but no appearance tonight I'd love to be wrong though
