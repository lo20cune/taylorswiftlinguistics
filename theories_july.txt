Title: Theory Megathread July 2024
Selftext: You know the drill
Comments:
 What theories do you all have for the London shows Do you think she'll bring out any special guests like she did in June Do you think a second opening act will be added like in June Are you clowning for a Rep TV announcement
 Am I clowning or is this a three I know people thought yesterday but I think tonight
 Unpopular opinion I don't think the 1989 outfits are an easter egg or are something that need to be tracked Maybe she's saving the all green outfit for Debut TV announcement and maybe she doesn't repeat pieces of clothing in the same city but other than that I think it's just what she feels like wearing that night
 This was a masterclass in confirmation bias
 Join us in the official August Clowning megathread
 We need an August thread Because I'm smelling salt air with a hint of SNAKES in the air
 We really could be seeing the rep tv cover tomorrow
 Her three latest Instagram posts have a hidden count down via exclamation points btw    and then   and most recently  Basically 3 2 1 LGB In addition people have pointed out that she's holding up two fingers on the eight post 82 and in some music video her nails are on 82 While some people think this means Rep TV announced on August 2nd I'm also wondering Could it be a Rep AND Debut double announcement tonight If not tomorrow night Maybe that's TOO much but a girl can hope Other reasons I'm finally clowning  Outfit color combinations that other people are tracking but I don't understand save for the reference to the LWYMMD music video  The 2s never stopped she teased two before TTPD to hint that the Anthology was coming but the twos are still everywhere  Something I saw about Swift renewing the trademark on Rep and Debut Taylor's Version And something about you can only apply five times and this time would be her last time So she has to release both in the next six months Not sure about this onewould love someone to look into that more deeply
 Just a random theory but Taylors next post will line up the grid but also lines up her vertical grid from the Rep era where she did a 3 post and then did a few posts and then did a 2 post then a few until her reputation available now post  what if we really are getting a Rep announcement in Warsaw
 Sorry not a theory but instead a hopeful request for any picturesvideos from Denver Night 2 that may include my husband and I  We were in 2nd row of section N right by the diamond I have a purple bob and am wearing a purplepink sequin romper my husband's wearing a teal shirt  Thank you so much in advance for your help
 Is it finally time you guys After months of speculation will August be the month She really did draw attention to August at the end of the post The OG rep era is when I really fell in love with Taylors music and I cant wait to see what she does with the rerecord
 What is taylor nation doing with this secret account of theirs
 Taylors been holding up two fingers even after TTPD was released and today July 31 she held up two fingers in her reputation outfit and in the comments put August in asterisks August will be significant Maybe shell announce something significant a double album both debut and reputation who knows But this what I find the most interesting On August 3rd 2023 she announced four new cities to her tour Miami New Orleans Indianapolis and Toronto On her official website three cities are not shown on her schedule Miami New Orleans and Indianapolis Why Probably because its an Easter egg and I think I know why as a New Orleans Swiftie myself The New Orleans Saints won the 44th Super Bowl in Miami 2010 at Sun Life Stadium against the Indianapolis Colts It was a huge victory for the Saints because we had rebuilt our city after being devastated by Hurricane Katrina very similar to how Taylor Swift rebuilt herself with Reputation Shes been incorporating gold into Reputation and has really punched up the black and gold mixture in her wardrobe these past few months The New Orleans Saints colors are black and gold and the 2025 Super Bowl will be held in New Orleans Travis Kelce has won three super bowls and I think he plans to win his fourth next year in a city that bleeds black and gold and arguably one of Taylors favorite color combinations because it symbolizes rebirth much like New Orleans So I think shes going to either release Reputation while in New Orleans or announce Debut Debut was released on October 24 2006 which is the day before the first night in New Orleans If she announces Debut I bet it will come out on Friday February 7 two days before 2025 Super Bowl since that is the day the Saints won the Super Bowl in 2010 Im super sad that though I live in New Orleans I couldnt get tickets because Im pretty convinced its going to be a significant stop on her tour
 With Kanye West releasing his new album this Friday she has the opportunity to do the funniest thing ever and just surprise drop RepTV Ohh here we go again the clowning in my head  Btw too many coincidences point to august 2nd sooooo I really think she will finally announcedrop it and end our endless suffering
 Im so worried for the rep TV cover art Im actually scared Stolen rep is such an iconic and perfect cover What do you think she will do with TV
 Hopping in that clown car and driving straight into August Lets gooooooo
 I sprinted here for the clownery as soon as I saw the Munich post The first picture being Rep The second Rep picture with the  I'm fully clowning
 i just thought of this the two fingers up in the eighth pic might be too explicitobvious of an easter egg what if it's another red herring and the 2 actually means a double something in august and rep tv is not necessarily the first of the two things coming ICDWABH mv or a way to draw attention to august 2nd in warsaw for something else i swear this girl has given me trust issues
 8th pic peace sign 28
 the exclamation points rep posted first two rep pics total the  the next post being her 666th August rep tv announcement 82 they could never make me doubt you
 With Taylor's new Instagram post Safe to say that August is indeed the month that Rep TV gets announced Especially with the Rep bodysuit in that first pic lol Soquestion is when The 11 in the post might refer to Rep TV being released on October 11OR a countdown to the final London show where it'll be announced Also the exclamation points everyone's pointing out how this new post only has one the post before had two and the post before that had threecould also signify an announcement in Warsaw Or perhaps the music video for I Can Do It With A Broken Heart
 Wait maybe the 11 on her caption means Nov and the  August refers to 8 month of the yearso Nov 8 which is a Fridaycould this be the date RepTV is released If she announces this August itll give plenty of time for preorders and vinyl pressing
 She used  TWICE in her new post Im clowning
 What does the 11 and meannnn ahhhh Im so confused in regards to her latest post imgemotet5_2rlwe1087 also the August
 The Rep photo with the  has me clowning I amgoing to Warsaw N1 and N2 so reaaaally hoping The glitches in the uk shop are making me think it's London though
 I think she will wear the greenyellow 1989 outfit tomorrow and greengreen on Friday
 Not the  again
 FIRST PIC REP
 only one  this time last post has  and  and the post before that had   and
 WHY DID SHE WRITE  August  THIS WAY
 Her thank you post is up and a reputation photo is first imgemotet5_2rlwe1087
 Does anyone think that she may be releasing Rep TV in September and announce debut TV in around October She can then release the final rerecording before Vancouvers shows and play all the vault tracks from debut TV in the last three shows in Vancouver I know Im clowning but she can finish The Eras Tour while reclaim all her masters at the same time
 Its been almost a year since the last rerecord was announced This little project to rerelease her albums has taken on epic proportions I know we got a new album but Im tired of waiting to buy old albums Im also whats known as a completionist so this might be my internally issues speaking
 I wonder why she hasn't posted a thank you post for Hamburg and see you soon Warsaw
 Goodbye July clowners it was nice clowning with you multiple times August is when we get the real juice
 the airs starting to feel a little salty
 I'll say it now She will announce Rep tv at London's last show It will be released few days before US dates
 We are getting a song featuring Kesha I've taken my natural painkiller so if I'm a bit conspiracyy I have a theory We will get a song featuring Kesha Let me show my working out  I think RepTV will be a double album REPUTATION THE KARMA EDITION  Disc one will be RepTV and disc two will be Karma  Colour Black and Orange   Prison jumpsuits are orange or black and white striped   What is an orange and black striped animal Tiger     Katy Perry  Roar  produced by Dr Luke  Lawsuit  Who deserves Karma as much as Taylor Kesha Also boycott Dr Luke He can't earn money if we don't play his music
 Have you guys seen the cardigan letters on twitterthreads
 I went to Munich N2 and I am just waiting for the her post on Munich in order to clown  Give us a breadcrumb babe
 My newestlatest theoryI can't clown anymoreI'm tiredBUTcontinues to clown anyways I've been thinking latelywhat if she IS waiting to rerelease Debut and Rep so she can base her next tour around them and another new album That way she could wait until 2025 to release them continue to follow her album release pattern of 1 new one year then 2 rerecords the following year AND Rep TV would be up for AOTY which it missed out on when it was originally released back in 2017 She has already made it clear that she intends to tour again once the Eras tour is throughit would be HELLA smart of her to do such a thing since Rep is SO WANTED by most of her fanbasewould definitely be a smart business move because who wouldn't buy tickets to another tour if it involved a bunch of new Rep TVDebut TVNew Album content
 I've always hated the there will be no explanation only reputation discourse mainly because it tends to be revisionist history and people think Reputation was a surprise drop HOWEVER I could see her performing I Did Something Bad as a surprise song leaving the stage after the acoustic set as she always does and then on the screen Reputation TV is announced I think she's most likely to announce it the first night in London 815
 So how confident are we all that RepTV is getting announced in August I feel like it will finally be the month it's just a matter of which date I think 82 89 and the London shows hold the most promise Question for everyone who paid more attention to the Eras tour earlier on than I did I only really started watching the Livestreams and such last August and September after the 1989 announcements because I didn't know the Livestreams were a thing For Speak Now and 1989 were there a lot of hints at the shows leading up to the announcements I only saw the announcements after the fact on Twitter and TikTok
 This isn't a theory but the stupidest dream I ever had so of course I had to share  I dreamed I was itching for another Eras Tour show and somehow found a resale ticket for another show in Milan and ended up getting a seated spot almost front row to the main stage The show was incredible I high fived Taylor like twice and she did surprise songs right after Lover starting with Should've Said No on guitar with a full band arrangement Except during the song something about her blouse don't know why she was dressed in a VERY folkmoreish style during this set malfunctioned and she started looking upset and right after during fearless she disappeared The concert fully stopped for half an hour everyone was asking what the hell was happening and then suddenly  The lights go dark again Some video starts on the mega screen Ben Affleck why him I don't even like him in a biohazard suit covered w the same pattern as Taylors rep suit shows up Everyone goes so stupidly crazy we don't even understand what he's saying There's a whole trailer for the album and then it quickly devolves into a trailer for Taylors first movie which is some sort of fantasy involving the girl from Bridge to terabithia becoming a journalist that writes cover up stories hiding a world of elves I don't know what this means but I do know clowning is starting to hurt me big time
 Rep TV is coming I bet there will be salt air during its announcement
 is it possible that some songs that were written for midnights were put on hold and released on ttpd instead
 I wonder if the creative choices made on the Eras Tour movie had any influence on the new Deadpool movie specifically as regards mixing the soundtrack The needle drops in Deadpool amp Wolverine are so much louder than normal in the best way and it kind of reminds me of how the Eras Tour also was mixed super loud Its a stretch but theyre friends so maybe its less of one
 I do think TN going live on YouTube today was prep for something I dont know what it could be though Be afraid for the London shows people
