 Heres the July thread clowns
 P
 When will the new thread be up
 New thread tomorrow I still hope we get a new video before RepTV is released but a hill Im going to die on is I dont think theres anything wrong with people clowning for the last two TVs and I dont think its what Taylor was referring to in ICDIWABH The the crowd was shouting more is specific to the tour itself and probably refers to something like an encore Of course people are going to clown for these albumswe know theyre coming Its going to be WAY different when TS12 comes along I dont think theres been too many Easter eggs about RepTV if Im being honest Id hope that a music video would shed some light on it
 What was up with the glitching at the start of the show Was that actually a tech issue idk whats going on anymore Repeating outfits glitches and YOYOK again How much longer till London round 2
 Yo I ran out of make up remover so the clown make up is staying on for a while
 The way the screens glitched at the start of the 6th era and through the 1st 3 songs error 321 AND we got the 1st repeat outfit combo for 1989 only for those anomalies to mean nothing amp be random coincidences gave me a good laugh Were nothing if not creative amp delusional
 July 19th is my last clowning date by then TTPD will have broken her personal best number 1 streak The lack of promo makes me think they want to see the through the albums charting and then from there decide if their current repTV plans works out to not overshadow TTPD
 It's been a great run but I'm officially hopping out of clownelia train Pushing any further clownery out of sight until one day she finally decides to drop RepDebut TV
 I held to my promise and didnt view anything related to tonights show while it happened Im officially not clowning anymore Maybe September 13th isnt happening

 My sister and I just realised that Taylor's next show after Dublin night three is on the 4th of July in Amsterdam so now we are clowning as we believe she is going to sing endgame as it mentions after the storm something was born on the 4th of July What could be coming on the 4th of July also the Amsterdam flag is red and black with three white X tonight Dublin N3 she sung Clara Bow which mentions Stevie Nicks in 75 and the Amsterdam flag was officially adopted in 1975 Weve also noticed that 2190 days from the midnights release on the 21st of October 2022 was October 22 2016 which was when she performed at the Formula 1 Grand Prix This was her first and only performance that year before she went into hiding and she wore a black outfit and sung her most popular love songs so 2190 days of our love blackout We are clowning so hard rn  Opinions welcome
 Next scheduled clowning date is July 17th honk honk can't stop won't stop
 Okay I think she was dedicating YOYOK to Stevie Nicks so that makes it better lol YOYOK is special to Stevie
 Clara Bow x The Lucky One was magical
 Dublin getting YOYOK twice is interesting
 
 YOYOK
 Clowned too close to the sun once again
 Ooh orange dress
 Ok Stevie Nicks left the VIP tent so shes probably going to do Clara Bow with Taylor  I feel like Taylor wouldnt do two surprises in one night but would love to be wrong
 Did Taylor hint at any possible announcements tonight
 This isnt necessarily a theory but Travis is there tonight yall
 Alright so it was the same rep outfit but that doesnt necessarily mean anythingsigh

 A SPEAK NOW DRESS WITH BLACK ACCENTS ITS HAPPENING
 today is a sunday 10ish weeks until 913 alleged rep tv drop date she announced ttpd on a sunday 10ish weeks before its release
 Taylor just said night 12 were warm up nights for tonight
 The screen is GLITCHING there I mean obviously could be technical difficulties but it was so uniformidk imgemotet5_2rlwe1087 Edit or was specifically right before the countdown Idk if its still happening but I dont think it is
 I will be clowning today with yall Why not Lets see what happens I meanthe announcements gotta happen at some point right
 I have a not so serious theory where when she's used up all the mixed color combos for the 1989 set she will then wear the matched sets whose colors all correspond to albums and those colors will tell us what album the respective surprise songs of the night will be from all purple is SN all pink is Lover all blue is either 1989 or midnights all yellow is probably Fearless  and because she's already worn all orange all that's left is greengreen which is probably rep If it's connected to the rep TV announcement I don't know but it will influence my Mastermind guesses lol
 I was sleeping when Midnights and SN and 1989 were announced so I plan on not viewing the Dublin thread at all and napping from 430530 my time Ill make the sacrifice
 In my clowny dream last night in order to push TTPD to the top again Taylor released the CAIL version of TTPD which had all of Rep TV songs included  Also Taylor Nation sharing a Bleachella fan outfit on Twitter today
 So it's confirmed by fans who were there last nightclose to her that she did smirk after the piano surprise songand the bracelets flashed green afterwards This reminds me of the 1989tv announcement the bracelets flashed blue at the end of the show the night before Tonight is a good night to clownwatch the latest video of audreymartha on tiktok it's gives so many more hints as to why June 30th might be reptv announcement including her mentioning 5050 and why she chose certain surprise songs
 Why have I nobody seen her commenting about an Olympics tweet containing Ready for it music with another ready for it reference and six emojis literally today That actually seems like a clue that Taylor would do
 Friendly reminder for announcements she seems to do them in cities where lots of eyes are on her My picks for album announcements are London Toronto and Vancouver Also Reputation is kinda a mysterious album so TN and Taylor wont be as obvious about it as the other rerecord announcements
 I am very casually clowning today because there really havent been a lot of signs buuuut if something suspicious happens in the show today I will be dialing up the clowning thermostat
 Me to my sister this morning you know today is 5 years since Scooter bought her masters Wouldnt it be so poetic if she reclaims her reputation for it My sister with no pause stop clowning again Haha one day well get rep tv
 Just a reminder that if nothing happens tomorrow we can't get upset at Taylor or Taylor Nation
 Im not sure if this has been brought up at any point But remember when Taylor reposted the fortnight short and the only difference was the snip of benji and the rug I present exhibit A followed by exhibit B I the comments below  Sir Benjamin Button These textiles may not be identical but are incredibly similar at least to me Side note I do have a bias for consistently clowning for Debut if not debutation With probably way too many theories and reasoning for why Which also reading through the comment section and thinking about it the 5050 could also be Taylor herself is 5050 on which album to release first or is clowning us all for going crazy with theories
 It looks like she's been going through the entire reputation track list again since the start of the yearafter she resets the surprise songs Based on this tracker created by 13mrperfectlyfine Vinoj on IG there's only 3 songs left End Game I Did Something Bad and So It Goes  I think she's going to pull another 1989 TV announcement where she performed the entire album first then announce it on the night she performed the final song which was New Romantics for 1989 I think she might still keep IDSB for last she hasn't performed it last year either I'd be clowning when there's only one song left from rep TV that she hasn't performed
 Announcing the next TV in the middle of TTPD doesnt sound that unreasonable to me She released the Karma MV and 2 more editions of Midnights 3 weeks after the SNTV announcement If anything drawing attention to her would do more for TTPD In the Midnights era the second single was decided on a month after Anti hero It has been over two months and there is yet to be a second single or a second video If shes not going to do anything for TTPD anymore then just move on to the next thing She can announce rep AND release The Anthology physically if she wanted to By the end of the year Im sure well have more lucidity with the last two TVs but it just feels frustrating right now
 Do y'all think if I say that nothing will happen tomorrow something will happen tomorrow Reverse psychology against the universe
 I dont get why Taylor would wait to announce Rep TV because TTPD is doing so well  announcing it wouldnt drive down streamsorders right Can someone explain  I feel like Im missing something lolll Edit also wanted to say that Zach Bryans album could top the charts in the next few days since country fans show up well so I dont get the waiting  Im genuinely asking
 I got a new low of 27 on mastermind so Im going to clown HARD tomorrow Voting double green 1989 top and bottoms
 Taylor has made a point of saying 50 a LOT in Dublin and particularly saying 5050 which feels like a clue Here's a thought I had 50 days before she got to Dublin is the first show of Eras part 2 in Paris 50 days after the last day is August 19 Her first triple mashup in Melbourne has always felt suspicious because August is on the setlist It included Getaway Car associated with both rep and the rerecordings August meaning august and TOSOTD track 19 I think we should be clowning HARD for August 19 in London
 Is something happening tomorrow guys
 The cheveron midnights bodysuits streak stopped at 6 today which is
 I dont think she did the so idk what that means
 She keeps saying 5050 in her speecheswhat does it mean Any theories
 This is not Taylors Version
