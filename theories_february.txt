 I think the sides of The Tortured Poets Department represent the stages of grief the bonus tracks are the 5th sidestage The Stages of Grief are 1 Denial  Fortnight feat Post Malone Two weeks a period of denial a break where you try to convince yourself that the situation is only temporary  The Tortured Poets Department Reflecting on the emotional turmoil within the relationship possibly denying or downplaying its severity  My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys Despite signs of trouble rationalizing a partner's behavior as expressions of love rather than acknowledging the harm caused  Down Bad Beginning to acknowledge the reality of the situation but still struggling to accept the depth of their pain and the lack of reciprocity in the relationship 2 Anger  So Long London Expressing anger towards the setting of the relationship symbolizing a desire to leave behind painful memories  But Daddy I Love Him Confronting conflicting emotions of love and anger possibly blaming oneself or others for the situation Sylvia Plath has a collection of poetry titled Ariel  Fresh Out the Slammer Embraces anger and begins to express frustration and a desire for freedom from emotional confinement  Florida feat Florence  the Machine Represents a breakthrough moment where she asserts her independence and pursues happiness outside the relationship 3 Bargaining  Guilty as Sin Enters the stage of bargaining questioning one's own actions and seeking to assign blame  Whos Afraid of Little Old Me Attempts to regain a sense of control or power in the situation possibly through manipulation or intimidation  I Can Fix Him No Really I Can Clings to the hope of salvaging the relationship bargaining with oneself and making unrealistic promises  loml Despite the turmoil holds onto the belief that the relationship is the love of my life struggling to let go 4 Depression  I Can Do It With a Broken Heart Accepts the reality of the pain and begins to navigate life with a broken heart  The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived Feels insignificant and powerless in the face of the situation sinking deeper into depression  The Alchemy Represents the transformative process of healing though it comes with its own pain and challenges  Clara Bow Despite being the it girl Clara was depressed 5 Acceptance  The Manuscript Embraces creative expression as a means of processing the experience and moving towards acceptance  The Bolter Accepts the need to move on and let go releasing oneself from emotional burdens  The Albatross Acknowledges and releases the weight of guilt and responsibility allowing for emotional healing  The Black Dog Faces and overcomes the darkest aspects of the experience emerging stronger and wiser on the journey towards acceptance I am obviously making a lot of leaps here and complete guesses but I am very excited for TTPD
 Sister albums
 my speculation around the Tortured Poets variantsstages of grief theory as well as how it might tie into Reputation her version this is long but it was taken down when made into a post so bare with me cause I really feel this could make sense seems everyone was expecting 5 variants to go along with the stages of grief but I think she's purposely doing 4 variants so that she can finish the chart with Reputation let me break my thoughts down so far the chart goes Denial  White  The Manuscript I love you it's ruining my life Anger  Light Beige  The Bolter You don't get to tell me about sad Bargaining  Beige  The Albatross Am I allowed to cry Depression  Dark BeigeGrey  The Black Dog Old habits die screaming Acceptance  Black   Here's my theory Many people were speculating that there would be 5 variants to fill the chart but she's specified that the black dog is the final Tortured Poets variant This lead people to speculate were we wrong  maybe they all need to be moved down one and midnights was actually denial we just didn't know it However I think she nipped that theory by naming the final variant The Black Dog clarifying it definitely is in the right slot representing depression with that let's break down the variant titles The Bolter  Someone who flees from confrontation or emotions who runs from intimacy and commitment  Anger as supported by the tagline you don't get to tell me about sad The Albatross  A person who prevents you from doing what you want to do or causes you great problems that you can't escape or alternatively a bird that myth says spends its first 6 years above sea before landing  Bargaining am I allowed to cryI am allowed to cry The Black Dog  A way to refer to depression or great sadness in a more poetic way  Depression I think she made it clear that the black dog does line up with depression through the meaning of the file name but hold on what else does the black dog mean in folklore the black dog is a hellhound that acts as an omen or bringer of death or doom misfortune and tragedy that in mind I was looking back on the reputation era the poems and taglines what is the tagline of reputation In the death of her reputation she felt truly alive I dont believe she would ever do a double album release as she would want both to chart respectively However reputation singles originally came as a surprise after her social media blackout No explanation just reputation My theory is that Reputation her version will come out as a surprise in the weeks following tortured poets after its had its time to chart doesn't take long for her to get 1 I don't think it will have the typical announcement gt waiting period gt release as the other rerecordings because the black dog is the omen of death The Black Dog varient WAS our announcementwarningomen of Reputation There will be no further explanation only reputation This got my wheels turning are there any Reputation era quotes that match up with acceptance In the reputation poem book right before she says the in the death of her reputation quote she says and may your heart stay breakable but never by the same twice which when looked on with current eyes reads very much like accepting the loss of her love walking away and not letting the same person break her heart twice This is my theory I think Tortured Poets goes through the first stages of grief and I think The Black Dog is the omen of the death of her reputation leading the 5th stage of grief to be acceptance  coming to terms with rereleasing love songs while being completely out of love this time So the complete chart would read as this Denial  White  The Manuscript I love you it's ruining my life Anger  Light Beige  The Bolter You don't get to tell me about sad Bargaining  Beige  The Albatross Am I allowed to cry Depression  Dark BeigeGrey  The Black Dog Old habits die screaming Acceptance  Black  Reputation May your heart stay breakable but never by the same twice even the colours would match up as even the black dog varient wasnt black it was dark grey Leaving her only black themed cover being reputation what do yall think of this theory am I deluded or does this kind of make so much sense I feel like The Black Dog being the omen of death instead of an actual announcement would be such a taylor thing to do also something unpredictable but with the clues there to be figured out after
 If I Google betty lyrics in Germany it says But if I just showed up at your party Would you have me Would you want me Would you tell me to go straight to hell Or lead me to the garden In the garden would you trust me If I told you it was just a summer thing I'm only 17 I don't know anything But I know I miss you Whats the point with straight to hell Never heard about it
 Not me watching fried green tomatoes and being like wait is that an egg I need sleep
 The store is black again
 Taylor Nation WE ARE  MINUTES FROM NIGHT
 OH ETA  not that it means a thing BUT I looked at the source code for this site and there are tons of derivatives including the number 288 as in different pages where that is a url and we just saw her sing to 288000 fans
 Ok so Im probably delusional as fuck because its 313 AM and I cant sleep but theres an account on TikTok that blends shades of paint that are swatched from different artists albums and I just think its very Tayloresque yet effing heartbreaking that she used shades for the lover album that would blend together into the color of Joes eyes which she highlights over and over and over about shades of blue Like the fact that the lover album had so much color and life and love in it and now TTPD is just shades of graysepia for old memories and sadness UGH this album is gonna wreck me
 Love how this thread was insane this morning and now the last comment in it is from like 9 hours ago Everyone bounced after the Tom foolery
 Okay I have no idea if someone before me already proposed the theory but what if TTPD is the opposite album of Rep Rep is black and its partially about falling in love with Joe their start of the relationship TTPD is white  opposite color of black  and is about falling out of love with Joe the end of their relationship Which then again could mean Rep might be dropped before TTPD as in tomorrow maybe 33 336 gt Rep but also 33 as in ttpdrep OBVIOUSLY it could be me clowning again and I know it wouldnt make much sense expecting Rep so close before TTPD however I have a hard time believing that she wont release it until 2025 like the 2 rerecord a year  1 new album a year theory
 Okay so I think they are saying look for the black and white Maybe it's piano keys But it's that short clip of a black screen with white coming up from the bottom and then from the top then the other message I saw this on twitter it's Google eyes like look for Then a black heart then a white heart then a little detective so look for the black and white I saw screen shots of these on Twitter idk where they originally are from
 If Rep doesn't drop in 7 min then I am never recovering from my clown era
 Website working again now I don't understand anything why Taylor Maybe It was just a mistake but I don't think so because people has found out suspicious codes in the html code so It has to mean something
 I think theres got to be a connection between the mashup she posted on her Tik Tok and the mashup she went live with on Instagram I dont know what it is but there is definitely a connection
 Did anyone else catch the Instagram livestream I was like OMG TAYLOR IS LIVE but then it was just a clip of her playing Dress as a surprise song and diving under the stage WHAT DOES IT MEEEEEEEAN
 Can someone link the March thread I cant find it
 Can't believe were saying goodbye to February thread It's been a completely unexpected one compared to what we were thinking at the beginning lol
 Have you guys seen the picture going around of all her eras microphones  And the only one in the pic that hasnt been used yet is All white imgemotet5_2rlwe1087
 I'm sure everyone has talked about this and how Taylor loves eclipes that A total solar eclipse will take place at the Moon's ascending node on Monday April 8 2024 visible across North America and dubbed the Great North American Eclipse by some of the media Starting at close to 2 pm on the eastern united states Then also an annular solar eclipse will occur on October 2 2024 A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth EXCEPT FOR Easter Island  and a small portion near the southern tips of Argentina and Chile the path of the eclipse's antumbra will be entirely over the Pacific Ocean The penumbra will be visible from southern South America Hawaii and portions of Antarctica
 Taylor Nation posting Today is a DOUBLE Day then posting a pic of Taylor holding up the two fingers
 So with a probable new variant coming soonany guesses on the album cover Im assuming itll be a slightly different shade from the others
 Can I offer my own little theory So with all the twos going around I was thinking about the most recent Paramore album and how they released the same album alongside it with other people covering every track AND IT WAS AWESOME I know this is incredibly unlikely but wow I can dream right I just wanted to post this in case I live in the universe where I'm right

 I know obviously the title tracks have already been released because of leaks but do we think she has any fun games like the 1989 games or midnights madness Maybe she could give us some real lyrics
 What do we think about the Times POTY article and TTPD lyrics Remember the NYU speech and the references to Midnights
 One of my friends called back to this post with all the Eras tour mics and how there is a white one that hasn't been used yet  Could this be reserved for TTPD surprise songs or a TTPD set in general I'm not feeling fully convinced she's going to add a TTPD set to the show but this is making me wonder
 I hadn't realized until just now that Taylor's bio on Instagram says All's fair in love and poetry on it The phrase All's fair in love and war is used in many ways regarding both subjects but primarily it is a justification for cheating It insinuates great harm not small slights Also with all the references to poetry and historicalliterary figures I'm not 100 convinced this album will be primarily autobiographical with only a few nonpersonal songs in it Yes poetry can be applied comparatively to ones life but The Bolter and The Albatross and Clara Bow I feel like we're getting a predominantly fictional and biographical artistic album with a little bit of her personal life sprinkled through much like she did with Folkmore
 All the threads are so dead right now
 Okay can we compile a list of all the recent 2s 1 Lots of  signs lately including taylor nation posts 2 Advertisements for TTPD variants are announcing 22 hours and 2 hours left to buy This is the one that seems the most  because those are such random times For common times to announce would be 24 hours and maybe 5 hours remaining
 Okay so I just went on the site to check the Singapour dates and I noticed on the standard artwork shes wearing two minimal band rings on her index and middle finger the same two you put up to make the V shape for two with your hands There's A LOT of twos floating around and I'm so scared for whats gunna happen
 Do we think the 4th variant will also be the target exclusive variant or do you think there will be a separate 5th target variant What if the target variant has all 20 songs
 I was thinking about a cool post from a while back that theorized TTPD drawing inspiration from the three lakes poets eg William Wordsworth and suggested that perhaps Taylor has two other artists in mind as fellow poets That could imply that two other artists worked on TTPD with her hence the references of 3's But how awesome would it be if rather than one album by 3 artists  or even 3 albums by just Taylor  there was a trilogy of albums each made and released by a different artist Like what if two other artists will release or have already released albums that are musically or thematically connected to TTPD and that's why she was holding up two fingers in pictures and speeches OR what if it implied that TTPD is 2 in this trilogy As in the third one is yet to be released and the first one is already out I know this is quite an unhinged idea and may not be practical And if she was indeed referencing two other artists that could just be about Post Malone and Florence amp The Machine featuring on TTPD and that's all But at this point I think anything can be possible so who knows lol P I'm just saying I think it'd be so freaking COOL if two other artists' albums we listen to  or will listen to  are actually puzzle pieces hiding in plain sight
 I think the feature film she wrote and will direct is a rerecording doc and it will be released along with debut TV at the wrap up of the eras tour
 Not sure if this is the best place to put it but what does everyone thing the title of the next variant will be if there is one Is there a reason people are leaning towards there being 4 Likewise what do you think the connection is between the titles of the variants so far
 Taylor has dipped her toes into using TikTok for marketing her music in recent years Midnights Mayhem  Antihero challenge specifically but thanks to the current UMGxTikTok situation its not gonna be as viable for TTPD not even mentioning how itll prevent songs from organically going viral on their own How do we think shell adapt Will she get creative Just move the TikTok strategies onto Reels and Shorts Do nothing
 So l was just thinking while laying in bed tonight and I thought l'd share Can we all imagine Taylor having a surprise concert she announces at the end of the Ears tour On December 8th she announces that there will be a concert in Pennsylvania It sells crazy fast super exclusive Maybe she announces it differently but that's not really the point Either way she announces that there will be a concert in Pennsylvania on June 19th 2026 20 years post Tim McGraw At this concert she opens with a duet of Tim McGraw with Tim McGraw Plays the ears tour set than says Now if y'all would let me play one last song crowd goes wild Miley Cyrus Oh And sings the up to when the lights go down it's the ending of the show from You can always find your way home Lights fade Taylor comes out in bedazzled cowgirl boots and a white sun dress While Miley sings and you're feeling like you got no where to go Then Taylor sings Don't you know And they duet the rest Than finally at the end while they are singing you can always find your way back home harmonizing back and forth Miley says This song hasyour turn Taylor says Thank you Pennsylvania for welcoming me home a picture comes on the screen of her in the outfit she is currently wearing that says October 24 2026 20 years sense her self titled album was released then saying Me My version coming October 24 2026 Thank you for 20 years heres to 20 more
 Yall this comparison  Miss Swift cannot be more unserious The image by itself is interesting background head tilt mens white shirt mirrored to his but then the name of the movie this was for The last letter from your LOVER I cant Yes this image is real posted in 2021
 I miss active album promo sm Ik Taylors on tour but I feel like I know nothing about the album and its like almost a month away from coming
 I hate to be a negative Nancy but until these leakers start providing more credible proof we really need to stop believing every single TikTok account that pops up  the odds of this album leaking this early are incredibly low and Taylor would NEVER secretly use leaks as a form of marketing to this extent Like a little tease sure But she would not leak bunches of lyrics or audio She hates leaks and would never want to bring attention to them
 Can someone explain to me what constitutes the dark academia music genre Ive seen a lot of people speculating that is the vibe for TTPD  is it more of a lyrical approach or is dark academia actually a genre that is a certain sound This is probably such a stupid question but Im curious
 Random question but who do we think produced TTPD I feel like Jack is a good bet to make some appearances again I really hope we get some Aaron Dessner songs this time around they always do amazing work together
 Meet me behind the mall or meet me behind them all
 Does anyone think theres any chance of her adding more dates to the Eras tour I havent heard any rumours about more dates being added in a while
 With country music making a huge comeback right now I would not be surprised if Taylor changes things and makes Debut TV next instead of Rep TV
 all this time my dumbass thought does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes was some kind of indirect reference to something else I never looked at the lyrics of that song til today when I randomly saw the beginning part of the song and was shocked when I learnt that Mrs Wicklow wasnt a phrase I thought Mrs Wicklowing was something popular most people knew about and I missed on
 Whats with all the 2s Taylor nation put out reminders when there were 22 hours left to get the variant and now at 2 hours That with her putting up the 2 fingers at the Grammys  it just seems like something is up
