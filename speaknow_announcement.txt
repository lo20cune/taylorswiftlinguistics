 Did anyone see the Tiktok with someones Vinyl with an incorrect pressing
 I saw something saying Taylor Lautner was singing backup vocals on Back to December TV I listened to it amp I kinda hear it but I was wondering what everyone else thought about that theory
 Anyone else cant find the og speak now deluxe version on apple now thats kinda slay
 when emma falls in love sounds so much like jump then fall the melody is similar i love ittttt
 when it comes to her older albums i prefer her young voice sounds more raw and emotional love the vaults from taylors version
 Her best re recorded album finally can hear the mature voice everyone was talking about when she rereleased red and fearless
 I love speak now but for some songs I prefer the original version namely sparks fly long live and enchanted You can hear the difference in emotion I hate saying this tbh
 Maybe its because this album is so quirky and fun and we arent beholden to radio singles but the little changes are so fun The way she says Next chapter really itches my brain in a good way and it already did before
 I dont know whether to listen or not Im so torn I was so excited but my husband is in the hospital and Im scared and I dont know if my brain would core memory it and associate SN with a bad time forever Im enjoying seeing everyones thoughts so far its taking my mind off things
 Castles Crumbing is my fav  A little disappointed it is not the first single and probably will never be a single Hope to hear it as surprise song
 removed
 This was my first TV release as a new swiftie and speak now stan and I was a bit disappointed at first but once I stopped nitpicking the differences and enjoyed it for what it was it got a lot better The vault tracks were amazing
 it was amazing her best rerecording
 ELECTRIC TOUCH IS SO GOOD
 smxksnxksnxksnkx
 I am obsessed with Better Than Revenge
 LAST KISS Omg its so good
 Enchanted is beautiful omg
 i had to switch to apple music cause i used all my skips on spotify and random taylor songs kept coming on
 So far every song sounds much better than the original Like not even the familiarity or the nostalgia of the originals are affecting me Omg
 Wow I really like The Story Of Us TV Was never one of my faves but I think I might like TV better than the OG
 Spotify isnt updated lol
 When Emma Falls In Love is so DebutFearless Taylor and Im
 Im missing the pain and bitterness when she says your dark twisted games in dear John but now I have other parts of the song I like more or feel more than on the original so win some lose some
 Anyone else on Apple Music suddenly also not able to listen to the album
 Is it just me or do the tracks sound almost lacking in like bass or something
 Enchanted is incredible Omg
 reminds me of the first time I heard haunted years ago Im getting a déjà vu brain scratch in such a good way right now
 Electric Touch is
 Better than Revenge is so good
 New time says July 9th for Apple Music release
 Is anyones violet vinyl set to be delivered tomorrow Im so curious to see what it actually looks like

 Have the signed CDsvinyls ever come out after the album was released
 guys does it come out local time or is spotify wrong
 So whats the First song your streaming Better Than Revenge
 What time does it come out
 Amazon UK seems to be suggesting that the CD versions split is going to be between Haunted and Last Kiss Interesting choice given the previous albums have both had the full base album on Disc 1 and all the deluxe additional and vault tracks on Disc 2
 Umm I was just on apple music and it said the release date for SNTV is July 9 anyone know whats going on with that
 Orchid marbled version is available on US Amazon I think the violet marbled version is the prettiest version tho I plan to wait until release day to see pictures of each one before I buy bc theyre all so similar lol
 PSA to Kiwi Swifties Its available to preorder in all variants now
 I wanna hear castle crumbles
 Love you
 Cool cool I'm fully waiting before I purchase anything because I don't trust her and I know she'll release new tracks later on I do wonder how she'll fit in press for this release while she's very busy with touring
 So someone apparently took pics os the vinyl and we can kinda see the names of some vault tracks I'll leave the link here so if people don't want spoilers they can avoid it It could always be fake though What are your thoughts
 Why does Apple Music say the album coming July 9th I thought the release date was 77 Im so confused
 why is this still a universal store exclusive and it is not yet available for preroder on amazon etc The previous TVs when did they become avalilable for preorder to other stores than universal's thank you

 Omg I hadnt heard this before I was wondering when she was gonna drop the next one So stoked
 Do you think there'll be other versions of Speak Now Taylor's Version CD So far there's only one version and I'm holding off from buying in case she releases a better version This is the first time that I'm considering buying a rerecorded album because Speak Now album is one of my favorites from her
 So excited
 Taylor held the phone upside down during Midnights Mayhem with me for two tracks Track three AntiHero and track seven Vigilante Shit We all knew that it meant something Taylor just annouced that Speak Now will be recorded for Taylor's Version Speak Now is her third album Track three  Taylor's Version of her third album But how does this relate to Lover her seventh album Well I don't know but I would love your input Sorry if this has already been posted
 Were all of Reds vault tracks known prior to release Was there knowledge of her ever writing The Very First Night and Message In A Bottle Wondering because people seem confident in their guesses as to what songs shes pulling out of the Speak Now vault
 the way were getting more midnights before any other announcements about Speak Now lead single vault track titles etc anyone else worried that between the Drama  and this release Speak Now wont get the full rerecording erafocus it deserves
 Now imagine taylor releases speak now TV without a lead single AND without announcing the names of the vault songs
 Anyone else think drama queen will be one of the vault songs
 If anyone is trying to get excited for this release I know I am this is one of the rerecords I was anticipating the most I made a thread of every Speak Now related episode currently available on my Taylor podcast  We have a Speak Now tour episode album breakdown and an episode about the announcement we were at that show If you listen to any or all episodes Id love to talk about them with people on here
 I'd like to have a conversation
 Back to December was the first English song Id heard when I was 8 Im so hyped for this album to come out
 And I could wait patiently but I preordered
 deleted
 Does anyone have a link to the full concert I love watching the lives and Im stuck doing boring paperwork so would love to listen back to it all
 I'm trying to follow the presales totals but having trouble Are the ever updated
 Did anyone else notice that the number of tracks doesnt add up I know its said that it will be 22 tracks total and 6 of those will be vault tracks but theres 17 from the original album Im confused will one not be on there
 This is the first TV album cover that I like I have a great feeling about this rerecord
 i've been watching the Speak Now World Tour on youtube all morning lol it's been so long since i've watched it i'm so excited for SNTV
 I cannot express how lucky I feel to be turning 32 and getting Innocent Taylor's Version in the same year
 This may be unrelated but do they restock the vinyls I really wanna get Evermore now that Ive been listening to all the music over in prep for the tour and its sold out on her website
 Any guesses on when the signed CDs will be available I've just checked my order and for Red TV they were available on November 9th so the week of the release Does anyone remember when the Fearless TV signed CDs were released
 When do you think well get the speak now tv vault decoding video
 First single OURS Elevator Buttons and morning People throw rocks at things that shine Also is pretty relevant to the current situation but the first big clue for SNTV in Bejeweled shine wasthe elevator buttons
 Lowkey manifesting Ethel Cain appears on the vault tracks even though the odds are low lmao
 deleted
 Not entirely SNTV related but  Fearless Speak Now and Red were the albums with more tracks  Debut 1989 and reputation have 16 songs tops Saying that do you think she'll put like 10 from the vault songs on these albums or something like 5 songs
 I feel like sprung loose celebrate is going to mean something The first being a lyric and the latter maybe a hint to long live being a single Maybe its just me though wishing and hoping
 OH MY GOD I DIDNT KNOW
 I broke up with my girlfriend We were gunna to the Eras tour On the bright side I can finally sell these tickets
 What has everyones experience been pre ordering vinyl from target I want the purple vinyl but with the Taylor swift sight I always seem to get my vinyl shipped later then when its available in stores and am wondering if its the same for target
 Violet is way better anyway
