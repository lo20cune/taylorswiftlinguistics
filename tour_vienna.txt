 Taylor Nation has confirmed that the Vienna shows have been canceled
 Hello I had initially bought 2 VIP tickets for Vienna but then life happened and I knew I wasn't going to make it to the show On the official FanSale I soldtransferred both tickets to my friend who lives in Vienna for 1euro since she had already paid me for her ticket and I wanted to make sure the tickets would have her name so she and another friend could go She got a notification that she was getting the 1euro refunded but what about the rest of the money We initially paid 927 euros for both tickets panic purchase Anyone have experience with this
 Has anyone still not received a refund I purchased resale through fansale and got an email on 820 that a credit had been issued but Im not seeing it yet
 Regardless of what the fanatic fans say her statement was terrible and its starting to show on a more wider nationalinternational level People recognize being talked down to and being lectured doesnt matter if the intention was there how its said will always be what people remember
 Got my refund 68 less than I paid
 Hey has anyone purchased tickets with a credit card Mine shows that the refund sum was withdrawn instead of refunded
 guys anybody know why tf did OEticket refund us 13 less we paid 146 and got back 133
 Data point I paid 345 EUR via OE and got back 34635 EUR I don't know where the additional 135 EUR came from
 As a data point Got the email that my ticket has been canceled two days ago and then another email stating it had been refunded in full not 80 today They said to allow a few days for the refund will appear
 Most people have already received an email about the refund right I'm getting nervous because I haven't received anything yet

 Keeping 10 of the ticket price is such a kick in the teeth after this entire ordeal We can't even get a full refund from this shitshow Fucking ridiculous
 Has anyone else just received an email update from OE ticket about their tickets being submitted for cancelation Still havent received a refund yet
 Well I was one of the unlucky ones who managed to get a ticket for one of the Vienna shows It would have been the only time I had attended the tour I took time off from work spent a lot of money on the plane ticket accommodation  Vienna itself is not a cheap city at all I loved what the fans organized in the light of what happened I'm thankful to museumsrestaurants in Vienna that gave freebies to Swifties who were affected by the cancellation While I dont hold it against Taylor or anyone in her team for not issuing a statement yet because it is a very difficult topic to comment on I believe Taylor didnt cancel the shows lightly what I do have a problem with is a fact that everyone seems to be talking about Swifties from Vienna I think that construction is untrue Not only Swifties from Vienna would have attended the shows Im from Serbia and I travelled to Vienna with a friend from Athens for the sole purpose of seeing the show We met fans from all over the world  US New Zealand Japan Italy Hungary Croatia Bosnia and a lot of people from Serbia and Greece Swifties from Vienna construction is therefore untrue A better construction would be Swifties who would have attended the shows in Vienna or Vienna show Swifties Another thing I have a problem is the fact that there will have been 8 London shows by the end of the tour and none in the Balkans Ed Sheeran had just had a concert at Ušće park Previously Madonna held a concert during Sticky and Sweet Tour back in 2009 at the same venue about 40k fans attended Madonna also held a concert during the same tour in Athens Olympic Stadium with over 70k attendees Beyonce kickstarted her The Mrs Carter Show World Tour in Belgrade venue used to be called Kombank Arena back then now its Belgrade Arena The reason Im writing this is The Sun article regarding possible compensation for the cancellation Link to the article  Of course Im aware it is The Sun but should these claims happen to be true I wanted to have my feelings known Options to film a music video in Vienna or to stream a live performance from a show held in another city are both highly offensive Again I must return to the fact that not only fans from Vienna would have attended the Vienna shows Music video option  I get nothing from it being that Im not from Vienna but from Belgrade Doing a stream of a performance that is happening in some other city  I went to Vienna to see Taylor not to see a recording of her It was not only a ticket for the show that I paid for It was also a plane ticket accommodation stay in Vienna as I had already mentioned none of this came cheap The only acceptable option if she really does want to do something for us who were unable to attend due to actions of some exceptionally evil people is another European leg of the tour visiting cities she has not visited during the first leg of the tour including shows in Vienna I have already posted on this topic on twitter yes Im refusing to call it by its name given to it by Elon and tiktok I truly hope that all the huge stars will stop forgetting they have a fan base in Balkans as well
 How does the refund work if I got my ticket through fanSale
 While I am happy that the attack was prevented and everyone is save its so maddening to see people defending the lack of any acknowledgement from Taylor and her team She is not allowed to speak like why She doesnt owe you anything yeah sure as long as your show is happening right Imagine she would have cancelled London shows  there would have been an uprising How can she not even say one sentence along the lines so sorry that Vienna did not go the way it should  I am still so angry
 Has anyone gotten a full rather than 80 refund Seeing lots of 80 on Twitter and getting worried
 Anyone who hasn't gotten their refund yet
 Its really annoying how there are people who after every thank you post are like but LA never got one but that swifties who wouldve attended the cancelled Vienna concerts are called entitled and parasocial for wanting some kind of statement from her I honestly cant get over it I wasnt in the mood to listen to her music since the concert got cancelled
 So she's really acting as if Vienna never happened huh I really hope there's a good reason
 Hi Please help us so we can reach Taylor and let her know that this is important to us  Petition for Taylor Swift to Reschedule
 I'm going to be a little disappointed if she addresses this to the crowd in London and not to the affected fans directly
 This is the only thread plus a Fb group where I feel seen at the moment
 Let me start this by saying that  Im not angry at her for cancelling the shows this was the right decision  Im not angry that she went out with her team in london Im a Swiftie from Vienna and my and my gf were supposed to attend N1 there This would have been the first time any of us would have seen her live Also i realise that as someone who lives here I didnt lose any money and other ppl are probably off way worse The silence from Taylor and her team has been very disappointing for me and a lot of other people Like I dont ever have Insta notifications on but i specifically turned them on for this occasion haha At first i was hoping that she would come out and say that she would try to come back or sth but the silence kept going Then ppl in Vienna started singing in the streets and making the best out of the situation At this point I thought Taylor might still be in shock so i didnt blame her for not posting BUT a message from her team saying something like we saw you singing in the streets and it was beautiful would have done a LOT for us all I hear ppl online say that she cant say anything because it would give more attention to the terrorists This does not make any sense to me The austria and international press have been talking about this basically non stop The austrian chancellor gave multiple interviews The austrian police gave multiple interviews Baracuda Music gave multiple statements I dont see how this can get any more attention Also Taylor Swift is the biggest artist right now everyone knows her shows and when and where they are and they are always a big deal in the city they are happening at In addition I dont think the austrian officials told her to be silent since the police said they would have given the concerts a go and multiple politicians came out to say they think the things swifties did in vienna are cutegreatetc Yesterday was kind of a tipping point for me again with the notifications I was really excited when taylornation posted and in my head I was like finally they say something about us but it was just them posting about where we can buy more merch Like what Also Taylor was seen in public yesterday and again I am not angry that she threw a party for her team being with ppl you like is great to heal but I was kind of like if you can do that then you can also give us some kind of acknowledgement right Idk the thought that she just walks on stage in london without saying anything feels kind of disappointing to me I realise that it is a bit parasocial to demand a statement from a famous person i dont know but you also have to realise that she is a brand and I am especially disappointed in her team for not saying anything She probably has a lot of PR personal in her team and Im sure they would have found a way to say something For the ppl that attend any concerts in the future please dont let this situation ruin your experience I just needed a place to get this out of my system Also to anybody attending london this week have fun and a great show Cheers from Austria
 Hey just a quick question Are we supposed to do anything to get our refund or will it happen automatically
 Has anyone actually gotten a refund yet
 Kinda disappointed that there is still no statement about the cancelled shows at this point probably there won't be one anyway and disappointed that many people are judgemental about wanting one and telling us to already move on I've been waiting for this concert for more than one year was exposed to so much Eras tour content from all the different shows on social media and was so excited that soon it'll be my turn to go and see it in my home country just to end up with additional costs a missed experience and people being belittling about the way I feel It's kinda funny that those who had the opportunity to go to the show and were having the best concert of their life to cite them are now acting like it's no big deal just a cancelled concert and that we should be glad to be alive instead Obviously I'm glad that I'm alive It was the right call to cancel the shows and I'm relieved that no one got harmed However it's disappointing that there is no acknowledgement of the Vienna concerts at all from Taylor or her team I wasn't even expecting much but at least something And I know that a statement doesn't change anything but it would have been somewhat comforting Instead there are posts about merchandise or new TTPD variants At least here in this thread I can find some comfort because we are all in the same boat after all
 My heart is breaking seeing all the London swifties get all excited for their shows I am really happy for them but I can't stop crying I was supposed to be at Vienna N2 with my mum and brother gave them the tickets for Christmas We can't afford to go to London unfortunately I am heartbroken
 Kinda hate that I expected the Taylornation insta story not the be about the merch sell
 This is my first interaction in this sub I guess I'm looking for some commiseration I had a question but first my sob story I traveled from North Carolina to Europe with my family to go to the Vienna concert we had N3 tickets We told them my kids 9 and 5 a year ago that we were going We were in London packed up and ready to fly to Vienna My kids we asleep I happened to wake up and checked my phone and saw the news Gutted Spent the next four hours awake well past 2am trying to figure out our next move Anyway the vacation went okay We extended our stay in London until our original departure date even managed to take a lastminute day trip to Paris to get their minds off of the reality of the situation Now we're back home listening to TS on repeat trying to move on  school starts tomorrow which will hopefully be a welcome distraction But my wife and I just can't shake it Part of us knows that a lot of the disappointment is also a projection of ours We also can't help but think that this is a teaching moment for our kids But I also know we'd do anything to make them happy well not anything  I'm not paying 10k on a resale site So as we're coping through everything I decided to join this sub It's been helpful to read through comments on this thread It helps validate my feelings But anyway here's my question I wanted to confirm that the best way to learn about resales for US shows is to just keep checking the resale megathread

 Hey Vienna This is a Twitter screen shot of our favorite Cornelia St resident Swiftie If you have a Twitter please reach out and give him some thanks he really deserves it
 I was in Vienna on Wednesday evening with tickets for N1 and N3 I had secured my tickets over a year ago worked overtime to pay for flights and accommodation made my outfit and didnt watch The Eras Tour movie because I knew I was going to see her in Vienna When it was announced that the concerts had been canceled due to a planned terrorist attack I was relieved that the concert wasnt moving forward That was the right decision However the lack of empathy from her team is absolutely cruel and disrespectful But they dont owe you anything There were over 150000 people in Vienna for this concert We purchase albums tickets and merchandise We invest in her brand and all we asked for was a Sorry Vienna They are all under a lockdown No they are not under lockdown because not even presidents or prime ministers experience such strict lockdowns for almost a week At this point for the first time in my life I cant listen to her songs anymore Time will tell if I will still be a Swiftie but as of right now her teams actions are speaking louder than words
 Commenting here again while trying not to be bitter about seeing the London thread pop up It's so incredibly unfair and everyone is making me feel like shit for being disappointed in not going or not having a statement or anything else they've deemed childish Maybe I am childish but watching them move on like the Vienna shows never happened has put a bad taste in my mouth after so much time and money has been wasted
 Hi everyone Please let me know if this is the wrong place to ask and Ill delete this comment I just purchased two tickets on viagogo to London since I was originally supposed to go in Vienna and I received a pdf copy of my tickets I didnt realize that the tickets I purchased were not mobile tickets They do not have any name on them Will I be able to enter with these
 Shouldn't we have moved to next city for the mega threads

 hi fellow Swifties Is there someone who had tickets for Vienna but decided not to go to Vienna and didn't attend any of the activities in the streets I'm from a neighbouring country so since we found out on Wednesday we decided to just not travel to Vienna we'd go by a car in the morning Now I feel like I missed out even more I don't even feel like I should count myself as a Vienna Swiftie even though I had tickets for N1 and I haven't attended any Eras tour nor can I attend London Anyone feeling the same way
 To be perfectly honest this whole experience has left me feeling pretty bummed about the fandom as a whole The incredibly dismissive and inconsiderate response individuals on this forum and others have had toward those of us impacted by the cancellation has made me wonder how much they actually listen to the content of the music they claim to be fans of If you begin to voice frustration about the lack of statements or care provided to ticket holders they immediately begin rationalizing and belittling you Yes it was a terrible thing and Im sure there are security concerns but do you truly believe that there were no messages that could be communicated by her or her team to show condolences to the fans The consistency of the feedback Imagine what she is going through and how hurt she must feel is so disappointing to me when what a lot of us are looking for is to be acknowledged This is NOT too much to ask She is not the only member of her team This impacted hundreds of thousands of fans Finally I absolutely find it gross that there appears to be members of this community who expect everyone to respond to a this situation in one specific way with one specific mindset Please I implore you to imagine if this happened to your friends and they voiced frustration and anger Do you really think the best response to that person who is already very hurt would be to chide them
