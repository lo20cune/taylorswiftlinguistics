 Hil I have era's tour tickets for Europe and I heard that the floor plans in Europe are open and standing instead of seated That being said I was wondering if anyone who had front of the stage tickets to the most recent Paris show could tell me when they arrived to the line how long you had to wait if you regret going at that time and when you would recommend arriving for the best view Thank you so much
 I'm an international swiftie looking to attend either a show in Amsterdam or Canada or if any additional shows get announced I realise as presale happened months ago in these cities and at the time I had no means to travel to these places I have missed out on pre sale codes I think my best chance of securing tickets is by a last minrestricted view drop of tickets by ticketmaster but assume I'll need a code for Amsterdam or Canada for this Does anyone have any suggestion on how I can obtain a code or any other tips on how to secure tickets Thanks in advance
 We need new regional megathreads please  The previous ones have reached the 6 months limit
 I got this email from Ticketmaster saying that due to seating configurations my seats were moved I have 4 seats and they were all moved a section over and over 40 rows back The new seats are significantly worse I'm going to have a meltdown  got these seats for my mom and now the view is way worse Did this happen to anyone at the June Wembley shows Any advice
 Yesterday I realized something I am probably not the first one If the show on 12th of May was show 87 of the Eras tour this means that her 100th show will be June 13th in Liverpool Being the 100th show and on a 13th could it be possible that this will be the day we have a big announcement Either a new TV or TS12
 I'm a relatively new Swiftie I always liked her but it wasn't until I went to see the Eras movie where it all clicked and I was all in By then all Eras tickets were outrageously expensive I told myself when new cities got posted I'd roll the dice and see if I could get lucky and get tickets And now that I know there won't be any new cities posted I legitimately feel sad I'm mourning the loss of getting to see her in person I told my husband this and his response was Oh god so I have to turn to you all I'm sure there's plenty of people here who share my pain
 Im thinking about taygating at Indy
 Do we think there might be an eras tour movie 2 Since she added ttpd and change the order of the eras I feel like it makes sense for her to release a second movie
 i made a concept poster
 what kind of time do you think youd need to get in the queue to be able to get barricade by the diamond at wembley
 How are other people coping with the jealousy and sadness of people going to multiple shows After a 15 year wait I finally got to see Taylor at Edinburgh n1 It was incredible and I can't get over it Immediately after I wish I had tickets for another show and I keep checking now but for logistical and financial reasons I won't be able to manage it in the UK I can't stop feeling envy for how many Swiftes are able to go 2 times if not more and wish I'd grabbed extra tickets during the presale when I got mine It's making me feel like I'm less of a Swiftie anyone else feel this way and how have they come to accept itget over it I know I am being ridiculous though
 For anyone whos been to the Europe shows using early entry what time would you recommend lining up
 Billionaire I think the media for sure neglects this issue and Im pretty sure Swifties do too The haters wouldnt consider it As an example Taylor has two sets for every show One either being used or torn down and one being set up for the next citycountry I cant imagine how much this alone costs Transporting the entire band and dancers I read she does this with her plane but I is it big enough ALL of her outfits are designed by world class designers right down to her tippy toes Then theres the band and dancers Thats only THREE very expensive examples Theres a lot more cost including regular staff marketing rooms to stay in food drinks hell even snacks So she maybe makes a billion She has a LOT of expenses to go a long with the ERAS Tour Im not saying shes poor or not making money Lol But that billion is chipped away at every single day
 Hi Im going to the last show in Vancouver and thought it would be so nice if we all could campaign together and have signs to hold up for Taylor thanking her for the last two years and giving us HER ALL Im totally good to make all the signs but if there are people out there that would join and hold them up let me know
 hey ujacyf02 the Discord you linked here is different than the rTaylorSwift Discord i was already in what's the difference between the two is only one affiliated with the sub
 What underwear does Taylor wear during the show This is not in a creepy way at all Im genuinely wondering what she wears because many of the outfits are bodysuit style and we never see any straps underneath Does she wear a strapless bra or just strip off completely between sets Does someone help her change Im genuinely intrigued what people think especially those with experience in performing etc
 Going to the London 22nd June show alone any advice from anymore else who went alone would be greatly appreciated
 Very curious if someone has sold or bought a ticket for the Eras tour at 3k5k I just cant believe some of the resell prices How much would you be willing to pay
 I really wish we could get an 'Eras Tour LIVE album' one day I miss the 'ooh ooh ooh's on 'put narcotics in all of my songs' during WAOLOM and other beautiful details that only the tour versions have but not the album versions
 Era's Tour will end in December  she just announced
 Have any swifties had floor tickets and have any advice on going to the bathroom during the show
 Yesterday it was the loudest stadium Ive ever heard Taylor took a moment to soak it all in and it looked like she was on the verge of crying Did anyone else see this yesterday on 0817 And does she do this at all her shows
 Hi I found someone on facebook saying that they were selling tickets to Indiana Eras Tour How can I know that its not a scam Has anyone bought tickets from some random person or third party seller I would appreciate any advice Thank you Please redirect me to the right place if this is not a good place to ask this question
 the people im going with wembley night 2 GA dont want to go early in the day but i do so we can have a good view can i go early and have them join me later in the day or is that queue jumping on their behalf
 does anyone know if there will be a bag ban at the m√ºnich show and what we're allowed and not allowed to bring in i got a pair of tiny binoculars i wanna bring plus water and snacks is any of that allowed
 I feel like such a brat writing this So I bought tickets to night 2 of New Orleans And I have been so excited for this show We are driving 115 hours and making it into this big new Orleans trip instead of doing a summer vacation I've seen so many clips and lives on TikTok that by now the show isn't new to me But I have been excited to actually be there in person I get that probably part of the reason of switching up the set list is because the show has been seen as it was by so many people by now And adding the Tortured Poets dept in as an era I meanI get it But my favorite eras are folklore and evermore And so many of my favorites have been cut I'm sad about it I've even been thinking about selling my tickets when I saw how much they're going for on stub hub I'm taking my daughter and she's not a swiftie but she has said she's excited for the show anyway Idk I just feel bummed out I have tried to like tortured poets but most of the songs are skips for me and I hate that I've been a fan since 2009 and had this experience so built up in my head ive never gotten to see her live before I know first world problems
 so basicaly im going to the eras tour and im really excited but i read that u wont get confetti in the nosebleeds so can i go to the floor when the concert is over to get confetti or how does it work
 Does anyone know if Floor tickets in the general zone together would mean my friend and I can stand together They arent literal seats and specific spots but areas right I was finding it impossible to find two tickets together resale at a reasonable price but individual tickets are easier to find
 Kinda specific question but does anyone know what the vocals in the intro of the 1989 set are saying During the transition from willow to style previously cardigan to style there are vocals mixed in and I can't tell what they're saying I feel like they might be backwards but I can't find a video with good enough audio to be able to tell what they're saying when reversed
 I can't believe I'm asking this but bare with me I haven't been to a concert in 21 years I saw the American Idol top 10 perform in NJ There were maybe 1000 people there It wasn't a singalong concert because I had no idea what songs any of them were going to sing Other than that I just saw orchestras in a theater and that's not really a concert per se To be honest over the last 15 years I have developed a bit of anxiety around large  loud groups of people So I never had the desire to go to one I never liked flying but I took a plane ride in May for the first time in 17 years to LA to tour SoFi stadium it was completely empty I had no problem and it was great An amazing day trip I saw the Eras Tour Film about 9 times in theaters It was probably the most fun I had in my life Literally I would go every Saturday night to see it and I had so much fun Fast forward to now and I think I might want to try going to the concert So how is The Eras Tour Is it a lot of fun I will of course be going by myself Any advice about them I absolutely love Taylor's music I sit on my balcony and listen to her cassettes with a cigar It's an enjoyable experience for me Is Stubhub  Vivid seats the way to go to get tickets I'd probably fly in to Toronto and leave the next day Thanks so much for your time
 Hi guys does anyone who have been to the show before know how hard it is to get merch in smaller sizes on n3 Because I have heard that most of the smaller sizes are sold out when you get to n3 And I wont be able to go some days before to the early merch stands because I dont arrive in the city until the night before So does anyone know if its impossible to get smaller sizes when you arrive to the venue on the day of your show
 1 Do we think The One has a chance to be a surprise song now that its removed from the main set list 2 Whats the hottest merch to get at the show now I know the blue crewneck and the quarter zip were popular but the hoodies at the show graphic in black and white are different from the ones online graphic in colors too 3 Are the black Tshirts with the poster graphic on front the same at the show vs online Thank you all
 After missing the concerts in my country Netherlands and realizing I really wanted to go even more than I thought I have set my sights on going to one of the shows in Germany Preferably I'll buy a legit ticket in advance but I've been refreshing fanSALE obsessively to the point of getting blocked multiple times for suspected bot activity and so far no luck I am crazy for thinking I should just go to one of the cities and try to get tickets the day of How many people have had luck with this strategy Thanks
 Im trying to buy tickets for the Austria concert Im a bit indecisive though I found both GA tickets as well as floor tickets seat 122 GA is 100 less though Which would be a better option My goal is to get a really good view ofc but Im also hoping to take some nice pics for my own memory I also already bought the floor tickets a while ago so Id have to worry about reselling them Thanks
 Going to Munich N2 in a few days and I'm extremely anxious since we don't have seats but Floor Standing FOS2 left tickets of which i first thought they are good but i haven't seen that there are two sections on each side for Munich so I'm a bit devastated now Also about the time someone needs to queue up to get access When should you arrive at the venue We're not even VIP so do we even have a chance to see anything on the standing areas From the previous shows standing areas seemed a bit more empty and looked like they haven't sold so many tickets there to keep it organized and easier to evacuate in case of an emergency So my question is What do you think we should start lining up at to get a chance to see anything Will it be realistic to see anything in Munich  on FOS2's when being shorter
 Hey everyone I gave in and spent way too much money this spring on one ticket to Toronto N6 I haven't been to any shows and just couldn't miss out on experiencing this once in a life time tour in person Something came to my mind today though I'm wondering what people who sat in the stadium seats not the floor experienced I am off to the side but about halfway up Were people standing updancing or sitting I expected that everyone would be up dancing but in the stream I watched today it looked like people were sitting  I don't want to be annoying or ruin anyone else's experience by standing if everyone is sitting but wow that would be depressing Those who have been already what did you experience
 Does every show have signs outside stating that by entering the stadium you are agreeing to being filmed for future use by the artist It was there for Dublin but curious if its just a general sign for each show or if its just for specific ones The exact same sign was there for Harry Styles at Slane so maybe its some kind of filming rule for Ireland and theyre just covering themselves but I was hoping she was filming for something in particular
 Seriously considering flying to Europe to see the concert in Vienna Wanted to confirm  I should only look for resale tickets on Fansale and should not trust StubHub is that right StubHub prices have tended to fall pretty hard the 23 days before a concert but if they're fake then it doesn't matter obviously
 I wonder if either Taylor or her team has ever thought of potentially doing a live broadcast of her concert for whichever place she was in at the moment Kind of like they have Livestreams on YouTube right now Then they could broadcast it to different theaters across the local area It's just an idea
 How easy is it to get merch inside the stadium I really want the grey quarter zip
 Hey I have the Ready For It VIP package for Murrayfield night 3 My friend who has our tickets is travelling down from London and most likely won't be there until slightly later when VIP early entry is at 3pm How does it work if we turn up late  do we lose our spot and have to stand at the back of GA Thanks
 So I heard that Italy has a unique regulation that prevents resale at high prices That is why you can sell your ticket only at face value My friend wants to sell me two tickets at face value price The issue is that I need only one but she insists I sell them together If I buy both can I sell the second one again and resale it for the second time So according to the concert rules she needs to change the name on the ticket the day she will get it is the end of June Then is it possible to sell it and change the name again What do you think is it worth it
 Im considering going to the London shows in August but cant afford the current tickets prices of 600 I want to book flights and hotels as soon as possible to secure cheaper prices but my question is do we think prices will go down to what they currently are for the shows this weekend in Sweden of around 70 minimum Id hate to spend all that money to get over there and not be able to have a chance at securing tickets
 I know there are several songs on the setlist for the sake of post preTTPD2023 dates that are only sung partially However I was looking at specific setlists using setlistsfm and I have noticed that some songs weren't noted as shortened at specific dates I made a chart to showing whether the song was sung fully or not that I've attached I've tried to look for videos or other sites talking about this but I haven't been able to find anything  Is this accurate Did Taylor sing full versions of some of the shortened songs at certain shows The song that I am particularly interested in is 'tis the damn season because as far as I had known she hadn't ever played the entire song live
 I'm was trying to figure out the exact preshow playlist for my show which was Glendale Night 2 I found THIS thread with the playlist from that weekend but it doesn't look in order or 100 accurate because I recall You Don't Own Me being the countdown to the show starting and in this list it has Bad Habit and Big Star listed last Can anyone help me with this Hopefully peeps from my weekend took better note of the night than I did Lol I'm trying to make a scrapbook of the that night for my friend who went with me and I want to be as precise as possible Sorry I know this is a longshot because we're already 1 year into the tour but thanks in advance
 What are people thinking about the likelihood of her extending the tour into 2025 Ive seen there are rumours about more Asia dates
 Is the cabaretstyle horn intro of I Can Do It With A Broken Heart available anywhere outside of YouTube Id love to hear a longer or more isolated version of it
 Does anyone know if they have opened the resale option for Lyon tickets
 This is not the right thread for it but the appropriate thread is inactive The seller I purchased the bodysuit from might not be able to deliver it on time Shes very sweet and tries her best but has had some issues in the past which I just learnt about I cant cancel because her telling me is too short notice and I probably cant find someone to do it for the same price in the short amount of time while she has been very sweet and open her time management isnt the best and it should have been here by Tuesday and she didnt even start and I wanted it to be here earlier but I did trust her word I did tell her she should calculate for international shipping risks and make sure she delivers it early enough so people can get replacements Anyway I am still trusting her and hoping for the best so it arrives here on time apparently one customer did not get it for Lisbon on time because DHL also lost the package  While Im still hoping does someone know if there are any sellers that take bodysuit orders I couldnt find many Just exploring all options right now
 Do we know or theorize that she's going to announce more dates As someone who lives in Vancouver I have a very hard time believing that she is going to end her massive worldwide tour here It just seems really odd to me I've thought she was going to announce some more dates like LA or something but it's been crickets I would love to hear others thoughts It also puts me in a bit of a panic about going to all the dates in Vancouver
 Has anyone noticed Taylor's voice has sounded tired lately She's missing some notes and she keeps switching octaves in the surprise songs and the whole TTPD set to avoid the super low notes and the super high ones Then I saw a tiktok accusing her of lip syncing during Tortured Poets and now I can't unsee it  I'm not saying she's lip syncing Taylor has always made it clear that her fans seeing a good show is one of her highest priorities I'm just wondering if anyone else has noticed her sounded tire or if it's just in my head
 Eras Tour Pregnancy Advice please My wife willl be 15 weeks pregnant when we go to see Taylor in London We have standing tickets and I think she might find it a little difficult If anyone has seen the tour and been 15 weeks or more how did you get on any tips
 Hello Im gonna go to the Dublin concert and was wondering Im probably gonna lineup super early in the morning but Im worried about bathroom and eating breaks If Im going with someone can we take turns going back to the hotel or going to a place to grab a quick bite then coming back in line or can we not leave the area once were that close to the door I saw the videos on the merch line and they freaked me out Also anything I should know about lining up early Thanks

 Hello I'll attend the concert in London on the 23rd and since I'm not from the UK I need suggestions how to get back to the hotel after the concert I really haven't thought about it but it's making me feel nervous now
 Need advice or reassurance about keeping our floor tickets or searching for a trade We have seats at the end of the catwalk row 12 which looks more like row 7 when looking at the map due to rows 15 being parallel to the width of the end stage My teen is 51 and Im 53 but with platform boots well be more like 5557 or a little taller so we might be alright but my 6 year old is 310 46 inches I could carry her but not for the whole show I saw some swifties mention security guards dont allow kids to stand on the chairs so Im trying to trade for lower bowl tickets but Ive never traded and it feels so risky We have aisle seats so that feels like an advantage but who knows if there will be really tall people or people holding up signs and their phones the entire time Should I keep trying to trade or keep what we got
 Can people respond with what kind of bags they brought to the show I have a backpack thats slightly bigger than A4 size but it would be very flat dont really wanna spend more money than what I already am AMS show this week Also are fellow nonVIP front floor standing planning to queue and from what time Thanksssss Feeling unreal that I am finally seeing Taylor Swift live after stumbling across Tim McGraw on YouTube in 2006 shes been my Roman Empire ever since
 gelsenkichen folks with hospitality tix  we got an email yesterday from the stadium with info about the tix entry time etc Actual tix will come 14 days before the concert So make sure you got this first email and mark it not spam so the tickets some through easily

 For anyone who has been to a European show already and had VIP left or right standing I understand that the diamond is most popular but which part of the stage seemed least populated Trying to figure out which way to dash and hopefully find a gap Im only 158cm about 52 tall so any view is better than a spot I cant see anything at all

 Does anyone have any experience with VIP standing early entry tickets particularly with wembley I'm wondering what it's like I have the karma is my boyfriend left side standing package for wembley and am nervous about the crowds in the floor after early entry did you feel like you could for example go to the bathroom or get water and make it back to your group at the front 245  11pm is such a long time to go without bathroom or water Furthermore any general tips for the experience would be so appreciated what did you wish you knew What time did you arrive Ticketmaster has conflicting times for early entry some parts of the websitesemails say 400  some say 245

 As the EUUK shows are coming to an end and for me that means that I will no longer be able to watch the livestreams due to the different time zones I just wish there was a way to capture this concert like a VR experience how cool would that be
 Sometimes I still have a cry thinking about how little me finally got to see Taylor live 16 years later
 Floor seats with kids or nose bleeds Hey swifties first time posting here This November Im going to surprise my kids and wife with Eras tickets But Im in a bind and need help I originally bought 4 tix on the floor but about 30ish rows back But I have a 5 and 8 year old and got to wondering how hard itd be for them to see Would we have to hold them up all show So I also got upper deck tix in row 2 so it should be better sight for them and theyll also get the stage effects But now Im second guessing reselling the floor seats Would they rather be closer Can any parents help me out which I should sell
 My biggest delulu is that Long live will be back on the setlist by my show

 I've got standing tickets for Liverpool with some friends I haven't given it a second thought as I've been to concerts and festivals before and I'm just super excited for the experience BUT one of my friends has just started getting really worried as she's heard loads of horror stories of people getting crushed at the barriers and getting separated from their groups at the most recent shows I've not heard any of these all I've heard is how friendly the crowds have been tbh Just wondering if anyone else has heard any of these horror stories or has acrually had experience of standing sections at the Era's tour that could give me some info to help me try to put my friends mind at rest

 I just received a friendship bracelet making kit and my wife raised a valid question about how I expect to hand these out I'm a 41 year old guy and walking up to groups of girls to exchange these will at best probably be unappreciated and at worst might get me assaulted by an unseen parent lurking nearby Should I just wear them somewhere obvious and hope people approach me to ask I've also got a lover themed shirttshirt combo pink sequened cowboy hat and a temp 13 tattoo for my hand so I don't really mind looking a little bit like an idiot D Hopefully I will look approachable if I wear all the bands on a necklace or something I'm attending the concert with my buddy his wife and their 5 year old child my other thought was just loading the kid up with the bracelets but them I'm worried she might do the 5 year old kid I don't want to share my stuff thing also part of what I think I'd find fun out of this is having a little pile of random bracelets at the end from exchanging with people I dunno I just don't want to be that creepy guy who ruined someones concert experience by approaching them

 Hey guys so Im going to Dublin and Ive been worried about my tickets being obstructed ever since I bought them last summer and I think I may be even more worried now So Im in block 120 front row and with the height of the tents I think there is a high chance I wont be able to see most of the stage But if that was the case dont you guys think I will be able to ask to be moved Because my seats said nothing about being obstructed
 On night 3 in Edinburgh I noticed that there was a microphone hanging down in the middle of the stadium is that normal Or does that mean they were filming the show There could have been more than one I was right at the back and forgot to check for more when I was going down but curious if other people noticed this and if anyone knows if my assumption is correct or if its always like that Anyone else see it on N3 or any other nights
 Folks whove attended shows in the UKcolder climes  its pretty cold in Liverpool Im from India but Im assuming once youre in the crowd it warms up We have standing tickets Any advice on how to dress for this
 Question for the folks in Europe queuing up for the floor several hours ahead  when inside how the heck do you handle leaving to pee Im going to be queuing up early for the Milan gig to get a good spot on the floor but whats the point if Im not going to be able to leave to pee and return to my same spot  Im used to just pushing back to my spot at other gigs but sounds like this is a no go for TS
