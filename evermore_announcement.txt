 Not to be all personal or anything but I was feeling really suicidal tonight and the second she announced this all my feelings went away Thank you Taylor omg Edit Cant reply to all of these but thank you everyone for the love I will try my best to feel okay and Im so glad this album announcement not only helped me but others as well
 This is absolute insanity  we thought we were clowning with the 9 tree emojis
 IS ANYONE OKAY IM NOT OKAY
 Id also like to mention she did this WHILE RERECORDING HER OLD MUSIC WHEN  DOES  SHE  SLEEP HOW IS SHE SO GOOD AT OUTWITTING AND DISTRACTING US ALL
 COWBOY LIKE ME LMAO YEEHAW YALL
 Taylor on IG Im elated to tell you that my 9th studio album and folklores sister record will be out tonight at midnight eastern Its called evermore To put it plainly we couldnt stop writing songs To try and put it more poetically it feels like we were standing on the edge of folklorian woods and had a choice to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music We chose to wander deeper in Ive never done this before In the past Ive always treated albums as oneoff eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released There was something different with folklore In making it I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning I loved the escapism I found in these imaginarynot imaginary tales I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your lives So I just kept writing them And I loved creating these songs with Aaron Dessner Jack Antonoff WB and Justin Vernon Weve also welcomed some new and longtime friends to our musical kitchen table this time around
 Taylor must be saying I GAVE SO MANY SIGNS
 Shes gonna be the first human ever to win AOTY TWICE IN A ROW omg her MIND
 I'd like to point out that Joe must have been right with her as she was uploading the announcement
 Taylor Evermore Me moves money from savings the checking
 2020 is REALLY treating us swifties right TWO ALBUMS
 Remember when 20162017 were the worst year for Swifties 2020 is the best year for Swifties only for Taylorrelated stuff the rest was shit

 OK BUT HAS ANYONE ELSE NOTICED THIS IS HER ONLY ALBUM COVER IN HER DISCOGRAPHY WHERE SHES NOT SHOWING US THE FRONT LF HER FACE RATHER HER BACK ALMOST AS IF TO SIGNIFY SHES RETURNING TO THE FOLKLORIAN WOODS
 Where are my nine original and unique vinyls And my 9 evermore cardigan colors IM TRYING TO GET INTO DEBT
 Weve all spent so much money on folklore What are we gonna do
 Im having such a hard time processing after how much buildup she had with the Lover release now she just straight up drops two albums a few months apart out of the blue Ugh Taylor is really looking out for us in this rough year
 Did anyone see how in her Dec 4th tweet to rollingstone she wrote throws self into the base of a willow tree by a reflection pool at midnight could be part of lyrics or imagery of the album
 More Taylor X Justin and a song with the National Holy shit What a time to be alive
 I said this in the other thread but it makes me so happy to see her being so excited about the music and it seems like this is such a creatively fulfilling time for her Love to see it Cant wait for midnight
 taylor said i am fucking crazy but i am free
 So like I spent about 200300 on folklore merch and like when I did my reasoning was Taylor wont release anything anytime soon I can financially recover and wow was I very very wrong
 WHY DOESNT SHE JUST PUNCH ME IN THE FACE IT WOULD HURT LESS ANOTHER DUET W BON IVER MAAM IM STILL NOT OKAY FROM EXILE HOW THE FUCK SHWNSUDNEHAJAGJW
 SHE IS GOING TO KILL US OMG I just love how she doesnt GAF about album cycles anymore and she just released MUSIC when she feels like it YES YES YES This was SO unexpected Omg I cant wait to hear what it sounds like Since she says itll be folklores sister record do we think itll be similar sound
 okay this is a REACH but does the album name evermore remind yall of the line from new years day where taylor sings you and me forevermore idk what this means but just a thought
 I love how she said in her interview with EW that her one outfit screamed tis the damn season I CANNOT WITH HER AND HER EASTER EGGS
 I love how folklore was a far away shot in black and white and here she's up close but from behind and in screaming color don't mind me I'm sobbing
 So we didn't get a holiday albumBUT WE GOT TS9 AHAHAHA
 We were making  TS9 jokes yesterday yall
 I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO SHOOK
 I dont like the its time to go as the name of the final track
 MARJORIE IS HER GRANDMOTHER ON ANDREAS SIDE
 SHE'S GONE COMPLETELY MAD BUT THANK GOD THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A MAD WOMAN
 These surprise releases I can definitely get used to this This is the best I'm so excited I probably won't be able to sleep in case I miss it Also how GORGEOUS she looks in that photo for the willow MV Hello
 DOES HER BACK HURT FROM CARRYING THE MUSIC INDUSTRY
 Is this a dream I dont want to wake up
 ITS THE HAIM COLLAB FOR ME I CANT BELIEVE WE GOT A FUCKING MURDER BALLAD FROM TAYLOR FUCKING SWIFT
 Let it be known Not a lot going on at the moment  I'm dropping a surprise album
 I'm just wondering if I should Venmo all my money to Taylor at this point She owns me
 EVERY TIME ALBERTA ANNOUNCES A SHUTDOWN TAYLOR RELEASES AN ALBUM SHE JUST SAVED CHRISTMAS
 Haim the National and Bon Iver as features I actually cant with her right now Shes also setting the WORST PRECEDENT because now I NEED a new album every six months NO WORDS NONE
 Guys this is the last time we'll be able to dream about what these songs sound like  Savor it Soak it in We are less than 24 hours from possibly discovering our new favorite Taylor songs
 RIP TO THE FALLEN MUSIC VIDEO TRILOGY augustbettycardigan 20202020
 This is insane in the best way How will we ever go back to waiting 1 year in between albums
 RIP MY PRODUCTIVITY All aboard the speculative theories train to clownsville
 this girl tweets not a lot going on at the moment as if shes playing animal crossing like the rest of us not randomly dropping another album

 She wanted to make sure we all hit that 000000 on Spotify wrapped before the year is officially up

 Evermore tracklist revealed
 I POSTED A SCREENSHOT OF HER INITIAL PICTURE AND THEORIZED IT WAS THE BETTY MUSIC VIFEO BUT OH MY GOD IVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY TO BE WRONG
 Ok but how am I suppose to listen to all of her albums as per tradition when I have to WORK TODAY
 MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR EVERYONE WHO IS STILL WAITING TO RECIEVE MERCH FROM HER PREVIOUS STUDIO ALBUM
 i have her post notifications on and as the grid was coming up i was like oh maybe an exile music video and THEN NOPE A WHOLE ALBUM I HAVE LITERALLY BEEN SCREAMING IN MY CAR ON THE WAY TO THE GYM DYING but also im like fuck i was finally done crying from folklore here comes another MONTH OF CRYING thanks taylor editing to add the new music video image has such strong love story vibes
 All my eras merch Ive ordered from Etsy with ts18 looks on it is going to be out of date by Christmas
 She's literally in the middle of rerecording five albums how did she have the time for this
 HOLY SHIIIIIIIT I NEED TO LIE DOWN IM FUCKING SHAKING
 My bank account when I order evermore merch even though my folklore merch hasnt even shipped
 Just woke my husband up to tell him My husband Shes a fucking beast
 Music video at midnight too SWOON
 I justcant This is unbelievable Truly She is giving us so much Im so happy Is anyone KINDA worried at the same time though Like shes gotten so much praise for folklore I would hate it if this didnt live up to its expectation and then that kinda dampened everything else Im sure it will I just want her to keep riding this wave of praise
 This truly came out of left field I suspected something was probably coming on Friday or the 13th but a WHOLE NEW ALBUM Incredible
 I really hope she will sell physical copies on the store
 Taylor I literally JUST got my Folklore vinyl on Tuesday you can't do this to me
 Just saw something interesting on Twitter  epiphany the 13th track on folklore was partially about her grandfather and the 13th track on evermore is called marjorie which is her grandmother's name
 Okay I feel like I need to scream here because its midnight in Australia and Taylor once again drops the freaking bomb news so casually and I was not ready for it Aaaaaaaaa
 Y'ALL I TOLD U 9 CHRISTMAS TREES
 IM FREAKING TF OUTTTTT TAYLLORRR SWIFTTTTTT OMGGGGGG
 Is the picture of her in a white dress on ig a wedding dress
 Idk if I was more shook by her suprise dropping folklore or surprise dropping evermore Like I cant believe she did this TWICE
 So this year we got Miss Americana City of Lover Concert Folklore Long Pond Studio Sessions Folklore Long Pond Video Cardigan MV Love Story rerecording Evermore Willow MV has this woman done anything but eat sleep and produce something new

 100 not what I expected to wake up to this morning

 I swear if in a month ya'll complain about lack of music videos or online presence from her I will fight
 Do you guys think there is significance in Folklore being black and white and Evermore being in color as far as the photos so far It just reminds me of I once believed love would be black and white but its golden OR The rest of the world is in black and white but we were in screaming color
 The Willow photo is so dreamy its like Love Story but all grown up
 And on a Thursday in lockdown I watched it Begin Again
 I would not have snoozed my alarm if I knew it was keeping me from this information Taylor Freaking Swift youve done it again
 Heres how cruel summer can still be a single
 My Reddit secret Santa just sent me a message that they preordered the album for me and made a gmail account for the link to go to
 What song are yall stanning Im going yee haw and stanning cowboy like me lmao
 WE JUST ADOPTED A DOG LAST MONTH AND NAMED HER WILLOW Im loving this
 Soooo curious if its gonna be similar to folklore or maybe a bit different more major toned because its all in color
 Us Maybe Lover is a two part album Taylor two part album
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN MIDNIGHT TAYLOR PLS I'M NOT MENTALLY READY
 As Ive been pacing anxiously and freaking out all day My husband I wish I cared about anything as much as you care about Taylor Swift And I ooooop
 Do we think there will be more fwords I want more fwords
