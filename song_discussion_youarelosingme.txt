 You been gone
 Has anyone else noticed how when she sings the line How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin' in the background there are some kinda subtle bells or something that sounds exactly like the intro to New Romantics Idk if Im reading into it too much but I feel like theres kinda no such thing with Taylor lol Any ideas what it could mean though
 Why is this not on streaming Predictions when it will be
 Well this song hits different for me right now Goddamn it Taylor
 Didn't love this song when it came out but yo this hits lmao
 Im obsessed with this song Cant believe it didnt make the album
 This song is 3 on Sirius Hits 1
 I just heard this on the radio
 IMO theres a lot of similarities with Red era We loved it because of the light  dancing in the kitchen in the refrigerator light I gave you all my best mes bravest solider fighting in only your army  Im a solider whos returning half her weight Idk I think its pretty cool if shes looking back on other break ups too amp there is a theme of comparing those two relationships
 A girl on tiktok posted a cover written in the opposite perspective and Im  Joe blink twice if you feel this way
 I wasnt sure about the simple chorus upon first listen but Youre Losing Me is threatening to take the top spot in my Midnights ranking
 I hear this song and it reminds me of my relationship with my partner when we were going through very difficult times I felt like our relationship was dying and I was dying and he had no idea because he was way too absorbed into his work and his own insecurities of failing at work I didnt speak my mind because I didnt want him to feel the turmoil that was I feeling cuz i knew he already had so much on his plate But by not saying anything how could he possibly know Why did I expect him to read my mind How could I expect him to see me if I dont tell him Hes not a mind reader Nobody is So the lyrics talking about wishing my partner would see me the partner feeling confused yes I get it I really shouldve said something  and my partner shouldve paid attention
 When is she going to release this on Spotify I need it so bad
 Hello Does anyone know how to get the mp3 from the files app into ITunes or somewhere I can play them on repeat without a computer I want to listen to Youre losing me on repeat but the files app makes it so annoying to listen to
 TGW is the person who doubted of themselves and didn't communicate's pov after they survived TGW ampx200B YLM is the person who tried to reach out's pov after they lost TGW
 I hope she will release this song for digital download
 I just realised that swifties have always been saying can joe alwyn fight as a meme obviously But looking at this after the release of you're losing me he wasn't even trying to fight taylor was begging him to fight little did we swifties know that we've been using this statement in this sense omg
 I'm super obsessed with this song I've been listening to it on YouTube and hoping it makes its way to streaming soon
 Not Joe switching off comments on Insta Oh Swifties
 Desperately in love with this song so hoping you all can help me figure this out In the prechorus she starts in the 1st person  I'M getting tired even for a pheonix Always rising from the ashes Mending all HER gashes Why do you think she changes the tense here She's a mastermind of course so there's no way it's unintentional Thoughts
 I really love this Taylor Swift song and hearing the sounds of the emergency room in the background feels like this moment of love is in need of urgent care It's truly heartbreaking
 Big Jack fan but my dude why First time I actually dislike his production The emotions and lyrics are so intense and personal Then the music is just meh A stripped acoustic would've been better Aaron producing would've been better Yes I'm irrationally upset about just this one thing doesnt help that the song is super sad
 I absolutely love this song I think it's such a raw depiction of a broken and lost relationshiphowever production speaking there's just one thing that bothers me about it and I can't ignore it every time I listen to this song it could be because I'm listening to the ripped version of the CD Why is there a lot of it seems like autotune in the phoenix line I'm getting TIRED even  ALWAYS RISING and the chorus Was it on purpose Her raw voice is so stunning in other parts of the song I don't understand why it was placed like that  again it could be the bad ripped version so idk Can you guys hear that as well
 Does anyone else clearly hear Imogen Heap doing backup right before the bridge
 Maybe unpopular but the heavy production on her voice takes me out of the song I wish it were a little more stripped down and raw
 I just relistened to the full album to see where You're Losing Me ranks now Curious to know where it ranks for other people as well Mine 1 Would've Could've Should've 2 The Great War 3 Maroon 4 You're On Your Own Kid 5 High Infidelity 6 Dear Reader 7 Hits Different 8 You're Losing Me 9 Mastermind 10 AntiHero 11 Lavender Haze 12 Midnight Rain 13 Paris 14 Karma 15 Bigger Than The Whole Sky 16 Labyrinth 17 Vigilante Shit 18 Bejeweled 19 Glitch 20 Snow On The Beach 21 Question 22 Sweet Nothing It probably would've been my favorite if it released in October because I was going through the same situation with my family and religion But I'm over that pain now so it doesn't hit as much as it could Plus it's hard ranking it with 21 songs I've known for months
 I will probably get down voted But I remember after YLM was released someone commented on this thread I cant find it that they thought it was actually a song to her fans and outward not directly about joe Initially I was on the Joe train that it was about him or at least a break up and I can still see it But after playing it on repeat on a roadtrip with my dog I actually started to move more toward the context of it being a song about toxic parasocial relationships and cancel culture in general and a song to her fans that they are losing her I challenge some of you to listen to it from this context Taylor Swift doesnt owe anything to us Yet so many have taken on this toxic relationship where they expect her to be perfect If anyone is curious of the verses and lines that made me reevaluate the context I will gladly share Im offering a different perspective Im not saying that anyones analogies are wrong But with all the attacks on her recently I just wonder if YLM was strategically released with the karma remix
 This song is heart wrenching Especially the bridge when she sings Do something babe say something Say something Lose something babe risk something You're losin' me Choose something babe I got nothing I got nothing To believe unless you're choosin' me I love the duality of her emotions She sounds composed on the main melody with anger and pleading mixed in but when she sings the lyrics in parentheses in the background it sounds like she is crying hysterically and desparate to save the relationship It's genius and just makes it to relatable and heartbreaking
 I desperately need this to be released on spotify
 despite a couple of wham lines i find the lyrics to be very mid and i HATE the voice effects despite liking the ones on other midnights songs it also feels likeweird to listen to so soon LOL it feels like reading an overly candid fb status of a girl you went to high school with who just went through a messy break up i feel a bit uncomfortable but i will be reading the whole thing
 I cant get past the tempo of this song Its such such such a sad song When I read the lyrics before I heard the song I was expecting something so different really only the chorus feels sad Does she feel too vulnerable to release it as a sad song Or does she just not want people to see her as sad Or is she just not sad anymoreTheres no way she wrote this song on piano or guitar this up tempo Like the lines in the bridge are devastating but shes not really saying it emotionally and the music isnt sad thats going with it Also between this song and it hits different Im so curious when she wrote these Because she very publicly and quickly moved on and says shes the happiest shes ever been Is she just saying that to cover up her sadness or was she just sad for a hot second and now good
 Any connection to New Romantics Could hear the main melody played at 150
 Im obsessed with this song I just want a sad music video with pretty visuals to go along with it
 Anyone else want to play songs like this on repeat but feel the need to reassure their significant other that your relationship is NOT in fact falling apart
 I wouldnt marry me either pathological people pleaser hits me in my core Ugh
 The end of the bridge DO something babe sounds so familiar to me Has anyone figured out what song it sounds like I don't think it's a Taylor song
 Okay this is gonna be long but when we first heard Bigger Than The Whole Sky lots of people thought it could be related to having a miscarriage and I think Youre losing Me fits really well with that interpretation Verse 1 gtYou say I don't understand and I say I know you don't She took it way harder its different it was her body not his We thought a cure would come through in time now I fear it wont They thought at first that they could get over it eventually but its been so long shes starting to doubt if that is ever going to happen gtRemember lookin' at this room we loved it 'cause of the light gt gtNow I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time gt gtPreChorus gt gtDo I throw out everything we built or keep it Talking about the nursery ampx200B gtI'm getting tired even for a phoenix gt gtAlways risin' from the ashes gt gtMendin' all her gashes gt gtYou might just have dealt the final blow She has trouble getting over it and him not understanding that saying something like itll be fine really hurt her gtChorus gt gtStop you're losin' me gt gtStop you're losin' me gt gtStop you're losin' me gt gtI can't find a pulse gt gtMy heart won't start anymore for you gt gt'Cause you're losin' me Her hart stopped because of the pain of losing the baby and she doesnt think he is enough for her hart to start again ampx200B gtVerse 2 gt gtEvery mornin' I glared at you with storms in my eyes gt gtHow can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin' gt gtI sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick gt gtMy face was gray but you wouldn't admit that we were sick Back to him not understanding how she feels and how hard she took it And shes mad that he doesnt feel the same sadness It sucked all the life out of her but he took the situation less hard and thus thought they were still fine Or can storms also be a substitute for tears in that case he reminders her of it and makes her angrysad by just existing because he was part of the bad situation happening Non native English speaker so not sure if that works in English as well ampx200B gtPreChorus gt gtAnd the air is thick with loss and indecision gt gtI know my pain is such an imposition gt gtNow you're runnin' down the hallway gt gtAnd you know what they all say gt gtYou don't know what you got until it's gone The loss of the baby and what to do now how to process this Hes running away from it and she misses what they had before ampx200B Chorus amp PostChorus Nothing extra to add here ampx200B gtBridge gt gtHow long could we be a sad song gt gt'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life gt gtIf they wont come out of this soon itll never work again gt gtI gave you all my best me's my endless empathy gt gtAnd all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier gt gtFighting in only your army frontlines don't you ignore me She became more private partly for him and now he wont give her al the empathy she needs he just wants her to move on ampx200B gtI'm the best thing at this party You're losin' me gt gtAnd I wouldn't marry me either gt gtA pathological people pleaser gt gtWho only wanted you to see her Im not sure about this one but they went out to a party and she hid her sadness there completely to not ruin the party for others But he feels betrayed that she will not be that happy around him and she just desperately wants him to understand her ampx200B gtAnd I'm fadin' thinkin' gt gtDo something babe say something Say something gt gtLose something babe risk something You're losin' me gt gtChoose something babe I got nothing I got nothing gt gtTo believe unless you're choosin' me She needs him to react to it she needs to believe he even still wants her Outro Nothing extra to add here
 I love how she references dying throughout the song theres the obvious heartbeat the line we thought a cure would come through in time the lyrics stop your losing me remind me of when someone is doing CPR on a patient saying were losing her and mending all her gashes like they are trying to save her I cant find a pulse my heart wont start anymore for you we were sick too far gone to bring back to life all I did was bleed but my FAVORITE line is when she says Im fading thinking do something babe Risk something Youre losing me bc I imagine Taylor on the hospital bed flatlining and her loved ones saying Do something And then at the end she says but your losing me the heartbeat is gone and then she is dead the relationship is dead
 deleted
 Ugh I'm at the end of my marriage and I feel like I could have written this Every word I think she and I were in the same relationship It sucks when youre unhappy and begging them to listen and theyre just like this relationship is great IDK what youre talking about  It's incredibly sad that Taylor has this unfulfilled need to be seen to the point that she made sharingoversharing her career and at the end of the day he didn't really see her either
 What does fighting in only your army mean Trying to figure that line out lmao
 Guys is it just me or I hear the tune opening tune of New Romantics somewhere around 153 time mark
 many people are saying this song ties midnights all together and while i agree i think it wouldve fit as the last track for 1989 even better YLMs bridge to 1989 is sonically what new years day is to reputation i know its ab joe but the bridge gives me clean vibes
 Say something Im giving up on you amp this song just hurt me
 The large audible inhale at the top of this song reminds me sharply of Need and that juxtaposition is killing me a little
 I need this song on Spotify officially
 fighting in only your army front lines dont you ignore me Im the best thing at this party youre losing me and I wouldnt marry me either a pathological people pleaser who only wanted you to see her  And Im fading thinking Do something babe say something Lose something babe risk something Choose something babe I got nothing To believe Unless youre choosing me Shes like when am I going to be your one
 Is anyone else continually wrecked knocked on their ass sobbing this song stuck in their head since it came out I am a longtime Taylor fan and know all of her albums inside and out as we all do here and I am still just wrecked amazed knocked out by this song How can you say that you love someone you cant tell is dying I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick My face was gray but you wouldnt admit that we were sick Along with I cant find a pulse my heart wont start anymore  for you and And the air is thick with loss and indecision People were complaining that its simple but FUCK this woman continues to write the most poignant biting heartbreaking songs she somehow puts into words what weve all felt before in heartbreak and its soothing and therapeutic and ugh
 I guess it's true that couples end up hating the trait that they once admired in their partner from lavender haze Starin' at the ceilin' with you Oh you don't ever say too much And you don't really read into My melancholia to you're losing me Do something babe say something Say something Lose something babe risk something You're losin' me Choose something babe I got nothing I got nothing
 How long do CDS take to produce like was this what she was recording at electric Lady studios last month
 I feel like this one hits different because she seems completely hopeless She committed herself to a really long relationship and now that it is over she probably can't see herself believing in love again She is probably extremely insecure wondering if most of the breakups were her fault
 Maybe Bigger then the whole sky was also a breakup song I thought it was a song about losing someone you love A song of grief But in context nowif that's a break up song
 removed
 This song is on endless repeat for me I love it so much Im currently writing some fanfiction and it goes perfect with my main character
 Maybe glitch isnt about Joe after all In hindsight it sounds like shed given up on hope of love and commitment with Joe but someone else sparked it back and brought her back to life and its so weird which is why its a glitch and not just normal love Id go back to dudes who give me nothing I thought we have no chances and thats romance lets dance
 At first listen I thought it was kinda boring until it suddenly clicks and become very sad DO SOMETHING BABE SAY SOMETHING LOSE SOMETHING BABE RISK SOMETHING CHOOSE SOMETHING BABE
 This song and Hits Different have shot right towards the top of my favorite TS songs this week Soooo good
 How long can we be a sad song  Imagine writing Rep amp Lover and then one day realizing all the songs youre writing about him are sad
 The Say Something part made me go back and listen to A Great Big World x Christina Aguilera Say Something that song makes me cry every time this one doesnt hit as much I dont like the youre loosing me part with the synth or whatever they used Do we think Hits Different was written post breakup
 I know the lyrics are world ending and I already talked about how the heartbeat thrills me but can I just talk how much I love the music overall on this song for a second The cadence in I cant find a pulse my heart wont start anymore gives me a lot of actual joy and the instrumentals on this one are exactly right for me
 Crazy theory maybe The youre losing me lyrics makes me wonder if Joe was an alcoholic Heres a breakdown of what lead me to this theory We thought a cure would come through in time  Is she indicating that he was working towards getting sober They thought Joe getting sober would curesave their relationship I just sit in the dark and wonder if its time  Taylor wondering if its time that she give up on him Do I throw out everything we built or keep it  This is where I think she indicates it was her choice to keep the relationship going as long as she did Stop youre losing me  The chorus definitely makes me think he was doing something wrong which inevitably pushed her away Shes warning him here that his drinking is pushing her away Every morning I glared at you with storms in my eyes  Taylor waking up in the morning after hes drank the night before and shes furious and upset with Joe How can you say that you love someone you cant tell is dying  This makes me think that Joe was still really in love with Taylor and didnt realize how much his alcoholism was affecting her My face was gray but you wouldnt admit that we were sick  Joe not admitting that he had an issue with alcoholJoe again not realizing how much his issue was affecting her I know my pain is such an imposition  Taylor nagging Joe to get help because she sees his problem is getting out of hand and Joe disagreeing that he has a problem Now youre running down the hallway  I think this is an indication that Joe was trying to get her to staykeep her from leaving because he realizes hes pushed her too far and hes realizing that hes losing something really amazing but hes realized it too late I gave you all my best mes my endless empathy  Shes tried to support him and show him empathy throughout his battle with alcoholism All I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier fighting in only your army frontlines dont you ignore me  First time I heard the song I was thinking what is he battling why is she saying shes in his army I think here she makes it obvious that he has some kind of issue and shes stood by him battling alongside him throughout the difficulties of getting sober Shes reminding him that she supported him through it all Im the best thing at this party  Shes worth more than the alcohol that Joe is making his priority what is typically at a party Usually alcohol Lose something babe  I think shes telling Joe he has to change here Hes got to lose the alcohol Choose something babe  Taylors indicating Joe has to pick her or the alcohol
 This song parallels so much of her discography but one I haven't heard anyone talk about yet is the way it parallels Maroon 'And I chose you the one I was dancing with''I've got nothing to believe unless your choosing me' 'We were standing holloweyed in the hallway''Running down the hallway you know what they all say' 'And how the blood rushed into my cheeks''My face was grey but you wouldn't admit that we were sick' 'Thats a real fing legacy'Do I throw out everything we built or keep it' 'I feel you no matter what''A pathological people pleaser who just wanted you to see her' It really feels like Maroon is reflecting on the beginning with Joe like Rep Era Joe
 I know the marriage lyric is what everyone is talking about rn But I honestly think 'Frontlines don't you ignore me I'm the best thing at this party' is way more heartwrenching Like the fact that someone has the ability to make TAYLOR SWIFT feel invisible is insane to me Idk I think its the fact that she has to tell him that shes the best thing at this party that really gets me Like how the hell does he not already know that And the pleading of 'Do something babe say something' 'Lose something babe risk something' I think she didn't want him to hide her anymore she wanted him to risk going public even if that meant he lost his 'peace'
 I just can't empathise with her Because she is the one being with another guy just few months after 6year old relationship and seems very much in love and he's the one being alone and sad according to some sources I just don't understand how the same album has Sweet nothings and You're losing me How can you write a song about being son in love and than nothing was okay
 Does anyone else hear the melody to Cornelia street Now youre running down the hallway And you know what they all say with Barefoot in the kitchen Sacred new beginnings
 Love the song and some of the mixing of her voice randomly reminds me of a song from the Garden State soundtrack I think Let Go
 Anyone else intrigued by my heart wont start any more for you I wonder if it means that although shes given up on Joe aka her heart wont bear for himyou she has not given up altogetheror that there is someone else her heart might beat for again Might be reading too much into this but I found the for you part kind of jarring in the song and was wondering if there was a deeper meaning
 honestly i thought the song was alluding to wedding vows in sickness and in health to love and cherish til death due us part he no longer loves and cherishes her and shes sick and dying figuratively there was also that marriage line but idk im not one of those smart lyrics analysis swifties lol
 I cannot stop listening to this song literally on repeat all day long Tay you really outdid yourself with this one Its SO good and SO heartbreaking
 Just checking in to say that its been a little over 24 hours since I first heard this song and I am still very unwell
 She was clearly more into him than he was her That kind of imbalance in a relationship will cause problems I think You're Losing Me really is her slowly giving up while still pleading him to fight for her She never had him '
 The parallel to Cornelia St
 I love it so much it's a 950 for me the only thing that it needs to be a 10 would be a more complete chorus
 The way that this song recontextualizes the entirety of Midnights oml Labyrinth and Sweet Nothing might be the death of me
 I hate that I love this song The lyrics can be applied to all types of relationships be it family friends and lovers
 But
 Horrified looks from everyone in the room but I'm only looking as you go
 I saw this comment on Instagram Can you fight Turns out they didn't want too Cries
 Anyway crying now thinking about how Mastermind now sounds like her last ditch effort to make their relationship work because of course it had to be right if she pulled all these strings and crafted it perfectly and shes trying to convince him of that and he just smirks because he thinks theyre just fine and doesnt realize that shes dying inside trying to get him to engage
 Another thing If you listen to the chorus for stop your losing me Around the third stop there's a slight crack in her voice And it's just so sad It's the way you say stop after you can't do anything anymore you can't argue Stop Stop Just stop and you breathe out and you have no voice You look at them and you just walk away realize no argument you bring will change their mind nothing you do will change it And it's when you realize that you say stop And you also say stop because your hoping they'll stop proving you right in how there's nothing left to do Your telling them stop because they are damaging you and you can't defend anymore To stop breaking what you both worked so hard on
 What do you guys think about the timing of it all Like does it seem like she's profiting off the song more by releasing it now rather than in TS11 Because it could be seen as being very advantageous of her to release this proper break up song now while theres so much being said about her speculations on the breakup  she knows fans are curious and want to know all the tea the Matty drama Ice Spice etc rather than releasing it in TS11 when some of the talk would have died down It can kinda seem like she's taking advantage of everything happening and all the focus on her breakup by planting this song so close after the breakup in an extra version of the album that you have to buy a CD to get a hold of while she knows fan interest is at its peak Obviously she would top charts and get a tonne of money no matter when she released the song but does it feel icky or profity to anyone for her to have released it now when there's such a commotion Rather than in TS11 when it would make more sense for this information to come out and it wouldn't seem like she's profiting off of it AS much because its not necessarily actively and specifically drawing attention to the breakup so soon after its happened and while theres so much discourse over it Does anyone think it's some type of revenge to get back at Joe Does anyone think she paints him in a particularly bad light
