 I am making my friendship bracelets right now and I started doing this with my friends
 My daughter got given a bracelet at the end of London N4 it says 'ASSPRO' we've been trying for over a week to decode it Its rainbow with hearts so no clear album colour coding
 Going to London tomorrow for an AEW show on Sunday When I get to the City going over to the Taylor Swift museum in Kensington Will have these in my pocket to trade
 Is anyone able to decode this
 Hi everyone Ive gotten a friendship bracelet and I cant decode it I would really appreciate some help
 Wanted to share my outfit as Im so sad I wont be wearing it again I also made a TTPD inspired jacket with hand painted back which Ill post in the comments I was at London night 4 and honestly it was the best time Ive never been to a concert so loud  Love seeing everyones outfits and such a nice community feeling Will miss the eras tour so much
 Wanted to share my London N7 outfit with everyone I absolutely loved recreating the Lover bodysuit and while it seemed intimidating at first it was a ton of fun to figure out how to replicate Taylors In total there was about 17000 rhinestones and sequins used on the front and back She took about 6 weeks to make and I honestly didnt have enough time to finish certain spots and close to 500 of materials mostly found on Amazon 100 worth every penny and hour put into the outfit and I think I found a new hobby Totally making another
 I am going to the eras tour in Toronto and am hoping to do a cowboy spinoff of the lavender haze outfit I have a bejeweled light purple cowboy hat and some white rhinestone cowboy boots but need help finding a cheap version of the shirt dress and jacket Thanks
 Hi Swifties Can anyone help decode this bracelet  Received London N6 Letters are NCTB but not sure the order So may also be CTBN TBNC or BNCT Ive gone through the discography and nothing seems to line up This is driving me nuts please help my fellow Swifties
 Hello fellow swifties I am recreating the midnights body suit I have a pair of white gogo boots that I plan on using but here lies the issue  no clue how to paint or decorate these bad boys Was thinking the Rustoleum plastic spray paint stuff so that it will move with the material and then covering with either rhinestones or glitter I refuse to use modpodge because Ive done that on a few pair of canvas shoes and it really slide off after a while Doesnt hold up So if any fellow swifties have ideas or have spray painted their boots how did they hold up My date is NOLA N2 in October so I have a little bit of time Thanks beauties
 My take on the 1989 top skirt and shoes I individually stuck on every rhinestone
 My fiancee and I are going as poison ivy and daisy She is wearing a green bodysuit and flowing green dresses but I am at a lost of ideas  I was thinking a flowy white dress with a daisy flower crown I've also found some white dresses with florals on them but the flowers aren't daisies and I'm worried people won't get it Dress with flowers Dress without flowers yes I picked it because it's giving folklore
 Brought my outfit today and attending concert tomorrow Last minute miracle or am I just desperate to have an outfit
 Outfit help PLEASE i want to do rep but i am worried a black skirt would look silly I know i want to wear snake tights but what bottoms do I wear with this  Would a black jean skirt look weird
 went with something different for tonight so excited to meet all of you
 Hello Im making custom bracelets for 5 each or 30 for 10 so if anyone wants to bring bracelets to trade at tour but is too busy to make them themselves Id love to make them for you You can customise colour wording sizes and charms each charm is 50c extra if I dont have particular charm you may have to wait for me to order a pack in All prices negotiable shipping prices will vary based on where you live Comment any questions you may have or if you would like to see examples of my work

 Hello I am getting ready for my first concert in Warsaw and I made friendship bracelets to trade Spent quite a few hours on them but super excited for the experience How did I do Had to take some artistic liberties due to some letters being used up but I hope it still makes sense
 Hey friends I did not have the goo luck to get tickets to the Eras Tour but I am going to Burning Man next month costuminggetting dressed up is a huge part of this event so I'm putting together a lowkey version of the lover bodysuit look Hot pink cotton bodysuit with the double pantyhosefishnets My question is for anyone who's done a bodysuit look What brandtype of pantyhose did you use for your layer under the fishnets My fishnets are great quality love em all set there But the only pantyhose I can find for a semireasonable price have dark panels around the waist or on the inner thighs which shows when worn with the bodysuit I am frustrated Shopping help would be much appreciated
 What bracelet string do people use for their friendship bracelets
 Hey swifties Need your help My friend and I are going to N2 in Toronto We want to make Tshirts with a pair of lyrics that go together What lyrics can you think of where Taylor mentions two things For example  love you to the moon and to saturn  she wears high heels I wear sneakers  he was sunshine I was midnight rain Thanks for all your lyric knowledge and creativity
 Just getting started who else is going to Warsaw Day 3 gate 3 I will be going alone and would love to make new friends to dance with Also drop your favourite phrase and I will make you a bracelet
 Got my wife tickets for a Toronto show in November She's over the moon and I'm very excited I need help with what to wear and which era I'm a bigger guy She hasn't picked an era yet but she has an amazing fashion sense so I'm sure it'll be fabulous I'd love ideas So far my favorite album is Reputation if that helps Thank you
 Hi I have a question for this thread and I think this is the right place I lack any sort of skill with crafts its embarrassing but I wanted to support Swifties and am looking for fun friendship bracelets Im going to one of the US stops and want to participate in bracelet trading  As well as that if anyone has any recommendations for an eras bracelet that has a beadgem for the new album that would be lovely Thought Id get one for my friend who got tickets for us  Thanks all
 Am I going to be underdressed I want to wear a blue jeans white top and white cowboyboots short red lipstik and faceglitter I want to resemble the 1989 TV cover shoot but I am affraid to be bummed that everyone is dressed very nicely and hyper and I am dressed more low key I have a glitterdress but it does not fit very well
 Hi Two days ago I went to the eras tour in Milan and at the end of the concert a person gave me this friendship bracelet that I have been having a hard time understanding I figured it would be the acronym for a verse of a song from Lover but I can't seem to find any that matches the letters What do you think it could be
 looking for any suggestions on how to style this top
 Last Minute Male swiftie outfit Idea Help I got a ticket for N1 one day in advance and didnt prepare ANYTHING outfitwise nor bracelets it doesnt have to be crazy but Id like to wear something thats swiftie enough for swifties to recognize it as swiftie Since I cant go on a whole shopping spree before tomorrow evening it has to consist of things that are either basics of a male wardrobe OR can be bought somewhere in Gelsenkirchen Any form of ideas will be much appreciated lt3
 Hi everyone  I finally got tickets to Gelsenkirchen N1 but since this all happened today I have no bracelets  since I am going alone I thought trading bracelets would be a nice way to make connections Any clue whether I could get any tomorrow or at the venue before the concert
 Help I am apparently in charge of figuring out an outfit for a guy friend of mine and I need to have it by Thursday morning Not for a concert but a TravisTaylor themed night at an event my friend group is going to Worst of all hes the guy who plays the role of I dont like Taylor swift but Ill begrudgingly put up with the shenanigans if it makes you guys happy so hes gonna complain if its not amazing and also probably will anyway Nothing extravagant but no Lover I would really like to do something Reputation BlackRed for him but the best idea Ive gotten is drawing snakes on his armslegs like the bodysuit with temporary tattoo markers by the way buy those for your eras tour arm lyricshand 13s protect your skin babes  It is TravisTaylor so Travis ideas are welcome too TIYA

 Hey guys any idea what this means Got it at Amsterdam N1
 This isnt too off the wall is it
 Anyone else make this mistake Hahaha
 As a 26 year old male who mainly listens to heavy metal and wears all black but only recently fell in love with Taylor's music I felt way too out of place and embarrassed to ask for a bracelet at the Zurich shows  1 couldn't attend the actual shows but I was outside of the stadium for the whole time it was breathtaking omg I saw so many people with those cute bracelets and I would have loved one but I just thought nah they'll laugh at you they won't give it to you anyway you don't look like a real fan If anyone knows where I could get one of those bracelets please let me know I would love to have one as a memory I'm sorry if posts like this don't belong here
 My outfit at the zurich concert 2 days ago
 Kids Eras Themed Outfits Im a mom and Im having a birthday party for my soon to be 6 and 4 year old daughters The theme is you guessed Taylor I want to dress them super cute since theyre the guests of honor Would love some sequins or something Eras tour themed but also keeping in mind that they are 6 and 4 I dont want any bellys showing nothing TOO mature Cute and Taylor inspired but age appropriate Gimme your ideas
 Made a Fuck Sewing Machines bracelett and traded it tonight feeling proud
 Is anyone willing to share the type of adhesiveglue they are using to adhere rhinestones to their custom outfits I would be so grateful Im making an outfit for Vienna N1
 Ive seen people put little streaks of glitter on their faces etc and i once did something similar for a birthday party by just using lotion and normal glitter Does this work for something as big and long as the eras concert Or is there special glitter gel or something Thank you
 
 
 Kind of basic but I really want to wear a shirt that says I cry alot but I am so productive it's just a lyric that speaks to my inner soul Anyone have a good recommendation for an etsy seller or somewhere to get one that isn't as basic as what comes up when I google
 I have my leftover bracelets from last year and was looking at giving one to a friend but I have one that I cannot figure out what it means Some of the letters are facing different ways It is either  ASIDLJIA or AIJLDISA Im leaning toward the second option because that one has five letters facing the same way as opposed to three
 I sewed my own dress inspired by Taylor's VMA after party dress It's so wonky and the inside is an absolute mess but it's my biggest project yet and I'm super proud
 I wore these to the show How did I not die
