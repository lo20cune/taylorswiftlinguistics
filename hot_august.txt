Title: Taylor Swift  I Can Do It With A Broken Heart Official Video
Selftext: 
Comments:
 I believe this 'MV' is not really the MV Let me explainI'll try to make it short n' sweet  Our wonderful Blondie dropped TTPD The anthology on streaming Many wondering why she has not dropped a physical copy of the album containing the Anthology songs Myself included With this drop of ICDIWABH and reading the comments about how the MV does not coincide with the song due to etc Okay we all know Taylor is really good friends with Paul McCartney  Paul being in the Beatles The Beatles have a 6 episode show called The Beatles Anthology Basically from what i gathered the show is surmising their music career and life with many clips from their early years until then So I just wonder Babes we are not getting REP until November I have a SWIFTHEORY that nobody believes That's a story for another timeanywho gtlt Is this a MV or the opening credits to Taylor Swift's Anthology showor nah Lol sorry I forgot to take off my clown makeup
 Grandpas money goes far
 It seriously makes me laugh these people that just come to post hate and negative comments But it's also really sad These people are not even fans you can tell by their comment history I just don't understand the need to go into a fan sub to post negativity You can not like things but the desire of some people that they feel like everyone need to listen to their hate it's honestly mental It's sad as a society the not just hate people have but the need to spoil things for others
 I like the concept disappointed with the excecution Honestly found most of it boring SO much of it was her practicing the choreography to the song and something about the pace just felt off  Did enjoy seeing behind the scenes clips like the thing she rides under the stage
 Its cool to see the backstage stuff but I would have prefered a non concert video
 Do you think it's a coincidence the first picture of this video is the stadium of Arlington  the place where she was when her and Joe most likely broke up and she replaced Invisible String with The One If that's not genius
 I'm afraid this video is an editing failure The rhythm of the song has nothing to do with the rhythm of the editing And it's very disappointing because I'm sure they had hours and hours of good quality material TS has the resources and access to talented people and more importantly this type of video has been done for decades A good example of great editing rhythm for a BTS music video off the top of my head is The One by Backstreet Boys This is the best song of the record and I really liked the BTS scenes but the editing is objectively awful
 There was a comment for this song describing how its more of a triumph on those days where you still pick yourself up even when you feel down Rather than an out and out sad song Can someone please point me to it

 I think the music video is a teaser for a documentary called I Can Do It With A Broken Heart The com site has been registered
 I think the whole point of the backstage stuff is because we are literally watching her do it with a broken heart I actually love that it was a concert music video
 Liked the backstage footage but generally dont like concert music videos
 She can do it with a broken heart and in heels Meanwhile me with a bad sinus infection I can not do it with a sinus infection I cry a lot but I am not productive Unless it's snot Please come and take my job today
 Love how we got the Behind the scenes of the show
 So my 3 year old Mini Swiftie in the making is currently obsessed with this song so she wanted to watch the music video 3 times in a row Am I complaining Absolutely not
 Taylor did the funniest thing by not announcing rep tv and instead giving us a video i love our random queen
 New theory this pink fluffy jacket resembles the one she wore in the You Need To Calm Down video The boots are rep coded IS SHE TELLING US TO CALM DOWN ABOUT REP TV
 I love the backstage stuff I think its really cool but this doesnt really feel like a music video
 This is absolutely my favorite thing that Taylor Swift has ever done
 Was this announced at the show last night I was streaming until midnights so might have missed it if it was after
 I paused her in the cleaning cart just to see what all was in there She has a little fan on and it looks like two little cat sculptures Can anyone else see that
 Meh she's done better
 What song are they rehearsing here Or is it an unseen read new performance
 The whole time I was thinking THIS IS LITERALLY JUST A BEHIND THE SCENES MUSIC VIDEO MIXED WITH ONE OF THOSE FOR A FORTNIGHT CHALLENGE VIDEOS THIS IS NOT WORTH NOT ANNOUNCING REP TV
 SHE CANNOT JUMPSCARE ME LIKE THIS Woke up in the morning and there's a whole freaking Taylor Swift music video
 All I want to know is what are these black and red striped boots Which era are they from
 All the details of this tour should be taught at the Taylor Swift Academy
 Lovely
 The video gave me butterflies and brought tears to my eyes Also I love that I now know she has a small train underneath the podium to get backstage quickly I was wondering about this during the show Running in heels is way too dangerous in her profession
 
 I hope they release a full documentary of the entire tour or if not of the tour the rerecording process
 Annnnnd i cried
 Loved that so much Legit did not stop smiling the entire video  I really would love a full behind the scenes documentary but I suspect we will just be getting this
 It was just mentioned on Good Morning Britain that a new behind the scenes documentary is due to be released next year
 removed
 Omg I open reddit this morning and WHAT I FOUND  I love this video
 Great lyrics
 I'm guessing that the all gold outfit is hiding with the all green 1989 and the green yellow 1989  They are having a party somewhere that we aren't invited to yet Edited for gold
 removed
 Love the song imgemotet5_2rlwe1067
 The lavender skirt outfit is the same one that she was playing tennis in The one where she was cooking with Travis
 I love seeing the behind the scenes so much
 It is possible that is Travis sitting there in the background watching rehearsals It looks maybe like him Editgtgt I don't understand why this comment is getting hate A lot of partners go to football practice to watch or training camp lot of partners go to watch musicians practice This was during her break and they were spending time together It might not be Travis but it could be him there in the background If it's not it's not that serious
 The new Midnights suit in the end means the video was literally edited like what yesterday Even the tangerine suit These are fairly new additions
 I love when it shows her rehearsing giving the 22 hat
 How do I find those ripped acid wash jeans with a yellow tint
 The quality of the clips just has me excited for the inevitable documentary about the tour
 I love this video so much watched it twice immediately Got me crying both times
 AAAHHHH MOTHER IS MOTHERINGGG
 So happy
 love this bc its taylor and love the behind the scenes footage but imo the clips chosen and things like the placementcuts feel kinda random she should employ a fan edit account and they would come up with a way better video
 Why am I crying watching this Its amazing I love it so much
 removed
 Am I wrong to think that because we got this its unlikely we get a behind the scenes film or etc Like this is the most we will get I hope Im wrong because I LOVE seeing all the behind the scenes stuff we never see and the technical aspect of the show
 I could watch an entire documentary on how her backstage production stuff works It's so fascinating seeing little snippets of how they pull off the transitions and stunts I'd absolutely watch a 9hour YT video on it all featuring the stage crew breaking it all down for us Taylor doesn't even need to be involved it'd be nice though



Title: We're witnessing history in the same way that the Beatles changed the music industry in the early 1960s Gibson reveals Taylor Swifts goto guitars during the Eras tour hopes for a signature model
Selftext: 
Comments:
 avoid the ads Taylor Swift's Eras Tour has had a massive cultural and economic impact worldwide With 149 shows across five continents Swift's gargantuan trek has become the highestgrossing tour in history setting trends instigating debates breaking records and inspiring a onceinageneration cultural moment In a poll by UK guitar retailer guitarguitar the pop star was also voted the eighth best guitarist of the last two decades highlighting her seismic impact in the guitar world especially among millennials and Gen Z Her influence in this sphere became even more apparent when the internet was abuzz with theories about the color of one of her Eras tour Gibson acoustics is it purple or is it pink Both camps were right  to some degree There were indeed two distinct colors made for her Eras tour a dusty pink and a light lavender so she has one of each confirms Mat Koehler Vice President of Product at Gibson We made a pastel pink one with a matching headstock and unique body artwork for her Lover tour It was a custom mixed color and the target was a dusty pink with some purple undertones That is what we used for her Eras pink as well But we did other pastel colors for her including a light lavender finish While Swift was previously associated with Taylor acoustics she had flirted with Gibsons on various occasions throughout her illustrious career These include iconic moments like her pivotal Reputation tour which fans describe as her comeback era and 2019s intimate NPR Tiny Desk concert which showcased her songwriting prowess However the Eras Tour cemented Gibson as her guitar brand of choice a move Koehler says continues the legacy of hugely influential Gibson players like Maybelle Carter and Sister Rosetta Tharpe One model in particular has proved to be a mainstay in her rotating roster of instruments and eras Taylor favors a fairly unique Gibson model  a J180 acoustic with a long scale length says Koehler The J180 is famous for its striking star inlays and it has been played by everyone from the Everly Brothers to Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day Additionally the long scale length of the J180 adds power and presence to be able to cut through a mix which is especially useful when playing live on stage I can't speak for her reasons but my guess is that it has the perfect balance of style comfort fit and projection for her playing In addition to the J180 of which Swift has several in different finishes she is also currently using a red crystalstudded Gibson J45 a wine red J45 an aged Murphy Lab 1960 Hummingbird and a red crystalstudded Les Paul But how much personal input does Swift have on each guitar We work with her team who execute her vision down to the smallest details reveals Koehler She hasn't been to see us in Nashville yet but we would love to show her the Gibson Garage and our historic archives and vault Theres so much history behind the brand which we know she would love Despite Swift's close relationship with Gibson we have yet to see a Taylor Swift signature model Epiphone's J180 LS is similar to what she's been using on tour and deemed the closest fans can get to a signature guitar at least for now Koehler however says that Gibson would love to have a Taylor Swift signature model He also adds that the J180 has long been the choice of music royalty so if Swift ever decides to add a signature guitar to her sprawling empire it would be one of the models in contention Considering her impact on whole countries' economies and institutions like the NFL a Taylor Swift signature would for certain capture more eyeballs and boost Gibson's reputation in a market facing increasing competition something Koehler and the team are very much aware of We're witnessing history in the same way that the Beatles changed the music industry in the early 1960s Taylor is a tour de force both in performance and in her prolific and impactful songwriting craft he asserts Her playing Gibson means the world to us I think of our team and all the talented craftspeople working on her guitars who share so much pride in not only what we do but what Taylor has done
 Oh my god please Gibson The amount I would spend in my dreams because Id never get near it
 Ive been screaming from the rooftops for a TS signature guitar for eons now Itd be a cash cow lmao



Title: 2 month journey into listening to Taylor Swift as a male
Selftext: I've been listing to her music for 2 months now and have gotten completely into it So far on Spotify I've liked 230 of her songs There's something about her music that I like so much more than other artist she just has a very good way of conveying emotion in her music Every song has quite a lot of meaning behind it where other songs from different artist are not able to capture as vividly as she does I've never heard any artist that i can listen to their songs on repeat In this case 230 songs on repeat day after day i do quite love almost all of her music there are just a few that don't do it for me Unfortunately being a male and listening to her a lot I do get some ridicule from my friends but its mostly just teasing still kind of annoying when it's with something I enjoy so much I've listened to a lot of music my whole life and have played instruments and do sing quite a lot and have not until listening to Cardigan for the first time found music that i was able to connect with quite as much After about a month I got the vinyl's for TTPD Evermore and Folklore and currently have Midnights Red and Folklore Long Pond studio sessions on the way My top 5 songs in no particular order are Lakes Long Pond Studio LOML Evermore Back to December and All to well Anyways just thought I would share this as I don't have anyone else to who will appreciate it as much
Comments:
 So male swifties like me do exist
 Another here Discovered her about 6 months ago I have had other artists that I've done a deep dive on in the past but none that have captivated quite as much or for as long Periodically I'll try and go to another artist but it just doesn't scratch that itch and I keep returning to TS My favourite albums are currently 1 TTPD full anthology 2 Speak Now TV 3 Midnights 4 Half of Folklore and half of Evermore But ironically my favourite individual tracks are Getaway Car Rep Out of the Woods 1989 ATW10MV Red and Cruel Summer Lover Go figure
 Im a 3040 year old man I love her music Went to ERAS Welcome
 I'm a 37 year old male and have been in absolute awe of Taylor for well over 15 years I am so proud to call myself a Swiftie Her lyrics and music have got me through some incredibly dark and rough times in my life and come out smiling on the other side Ignore the ridicule my friend after all it's YOUR taste in music and shouldn't be swayed by absolutely anybody else
 Her music is just so relatable I love how anyone can connect with her music She just has a way of writing she puts things into words I never knew how to express Makes me feel less alone and seen
 Welcome She is truly one of the all time great songwriters especially as a lyricist I've always said she is more of a poet than a songwriter The Lakes is a prime example of this
 Same here bro Haters gna hate Just keep doing You cuz nobody else can make you happy but yourself  gifemotefree_emotes_packthumbs_upimgemotet5_2rlwe6804imgemotet5_2rlwe1063
 great top 5 songs don't bother with the ridicule from your male friends women will respect you so much for enjoying taylor we see it as a green flag hahah
 Reading this is so wholesome In my country men and pickmes are hating Taylor and sometimes I get irritated lol So refreshing to see men being swifties
 You totally get it  Welcome to her world
 54 yr old male Music There is only Taylor Swift My daughter takes credit for 'making a monster' lol side note  for the past 2 weeks I have been haunted by her recording on the Hope for Haiti Now live album titled 'Breathless' TSlt3
 Kudos to you for overcoming toxic male peer pressures  There are so many men who love to shit on Taylor and deny liking her music to protect their ego and say they only listen to real music and Taylor is for girls and whatnot It might sound stupid but you're really brave for accepting you like her music
 Since we're all coming out of the wood work here I'm a 29 year old guy Been a fan since just before Red came out I used to HATE Taylor Swift because my family would listen to this one radio station that literally played the same 5 songs on repeat and one of them was a Taylor Swift song I got bored of listening to my usual favourites Slipknot Metallica BFMV Blink182 Sum 41 etc and thought maybe I'll give this girls music a chance I pushed through my initial eye rolling and just fell in love I loved her country stuff through and trough and when she started to switch up her sound to be more poppy I was still on board 1989 is my favourite album I've been to the 1989 tour Reputation even though I'm really not a fan of that album and the Eras Tour My wife however is not a fan at all I had to drag her to both Rep and Eras tours So it's funny to me that we kind of flip the norm on its head in that regard
 I cant get over men just NOT listening to female artists because theyre women wtfff
 Discovered her some years back and been a fan since lol folklore gets played religiously next to slipknot for me lol
 We appreciate you sharing with us PC  There is a certain je ne sais quoi about her music that just keeps you coming back like The Beatles or The Rolling Stones You dont often hear people with such talent I think my favorites are Enchanted Bejeweled Mastermind Blank Space and The Prophecy
 Heuyyy nice I have always really liked her music since I was a little boy and my sister let me hear Love Story I loved Blank Space and Wildest dreams and whatnot but I was hooked when reputation came out That entire album became my anthem it was the first album I actually downloaded and listened to on repeat Gosh I love her craftsmanship I have a similar thing with Lana del Rey and it made me wonder about guys that wrote such meaningful lyrics but so far I haven't really found someone that hits rigth Harry Styles sometimes Ed Sheeran sometimes Billy Joel and Elton John are also really good But it's always a bit more distant with Taylor I really feel like she's crying behind a piano and that's what the connection brings
 A bit jealous of your long pond studios vinyl tbh
 Appreciation to all the male swifties  I will stop assuming now that the majority of the men at her concerts are there because they are boyfriends friends or dads of the actual swifties
 if people listened to her with an open mind they will realize how good she is read a tweet the other day which said taylor is commercially overrated and critically underrared and I definitely agree with the latter part people these days are so heavily influenced by what's socially considered cool or not that they forget to have their own opinions sorry for the rant welcome to the swiftie verse lol
 Yep I'm 62 Didn't know a thing about Taylor until she got Person of the Year then decided to watch the Eras Tour movie to see what all the fuss was about Now I'm captivated I listen to her in the car all the time She is what happens when you combine talent hard work family support sufficient resources and an outgoing friendly personality I think she is probably the most significant artist of our time Elvis the Beatles and Michael Jackson's bodies of work do not compare to the breadth and consistent quality of hers
 This is great I hope you get into 1989 and Reputation too as thats where I started my male Taylor fan journey
 also a dude ive been slowly getting more and more into her music over the past year shes incredible one of the best songwriters and lyricists of all time even if you cant relate to all of her stories shes just got such a talent for storytelling and an insane ear for melodies
 There is someone like me
 Some people would die without being able to tease guys who like girly stuff
 It's me hi I'm a male swiftie it's me Been here since 2021 and was supposed to see the eras tour last month Glad you're here and enjoy her music
 Welcome to the club brother swiftie Your top 5 are some of my top 5 so excellent taste youre developing Excited for you to collect more of vinyl its such a fun part of her music for me
 Welcome Brother 2 time father of boys37 and nobody in the Family is into Tay Tay Enjoy the nice community
 Love reading this so much My teenage sons also love her music amp I am so lucky to be able to take them and my daughter to see Eras in Miami in next month
 three of my closest people 2728 yo men absolutely love taylor swift we all basically cried in equal measure when we couldnt get eras tour tickets one of them went to an apartment near a stadium where she was playing just so he could hear it from a distance you are not alone haha
 Please don't take this disrespectfully but this as a male shit has got to die Taylor Swift makes good music and you can justenjoy it If we I am also male keep qualifying our enjoyment of an objectively good musician we're just undermining that idea
 I am a woman  however I discovered her music with her release of midnight and I have been listening to her almost her entire discography on repeat for almost two years straight lol I feel the same way about her music  I just love her music so much I love the words she uses and the things she says and I dont really get tired of it I dont know how else to describe it
 Welcome friend were happy to have you
 24yo male swiftie checking in I dove head first into her discography very early last year Ive always liked her radio hits and wondered what else she had hidden from the mainstream radio I started from the very beginning and listened through every album in release order and now here i am working on 2 years of being a full fledged swiftie haha I feel the same way you do about her music i have yet to find an artist thats moved me or been able to connect with their songs quite like Taylor Swift has Shes able to convey such strong emotion and tell stories so vividly you can picture it Ive gotten a lot of shit for being a straight dude that loves Taylor but it clearly just comes from people who are insanely close minded Ive gotten to a point where i dont care anymore people are going to be hateful no matter what Taylor herself once said People are going to judge you anyway so you might as well do what you want But on the other hand the swifties have been so amazing and welcoming and have made the journey as well as being a fan that much better
 This is such a wholesome thread  OP I'm so glad you've gotten into the TSCU Taylor Swift Cinematic Universe haha I hope you continue to enjoy it  And don't worry being teased about liking Taylor while it is very annoying is practically a rite of passage for Swifties P
 happy for you my dude but you can just listen to whatever music you like you know
 Hey I have almost the same but in my top 10 The Lakes Evermore Back to December and All Too Well
 Me 53M too although to be fair I mostly listen to the 2 albums she did with Aaron Dressner of the National my fave band TTPD and Folklore but I do enjoy some of her other stuff
 Love this And youre not alone I got into her because my musician boyfriend at the time recommended her to me That was back in 2011 before she was cool lol I remember scoffing and being like Taylor Swift And he told me her song writing was amazing and that her lyrics were punchy and super clever You are the best thing thats ever been mine  I wish I could write that I begrudgingly listened to Mine and the rest is history We broke up not long after but my relationship to Taylors music survives to this day  and its thanks to that male swiftie
 Good on you As a boomer male it took me a long time to find out Taylor's brilliance as a songwriter a generational talent And yes I get teased friends roll their eyes etc etc but I just point out that listening to 50 year old prog rock albums is clearly an early sign of dementia
 Glad you gave her a chance and took a deep dive into her catalog Keep enjoying her music and ignoring the fandom drama imgemotet5_2rlwe1081
 How much did you drop on folklore lpss Literally top of my wish list for vinyls but so expensive
 I was lucky enough to see Taylor Swift in the UK in June and since then shes my favourite artist As a guy I know that its a bit strange but frankly I just dont care
 Excellent taste in artists and superb top picks The Lakes is so underappreciated
 Welcome to the fandom Been here since I saw her on the Jonas Brothers 3D concert experience
 Welcome Ive clocked the journey from yeah I know her music but shes not really for me To I bought tickets to the tour and made my friendship bracelets at about 812 months depending on how much time the incubating Swiftie can listen
 Taylor is also the only nonmetalhard rock artist I listen to In fact she's my top artist Makes for a funny yearly recap What can I say  she makes me smile
 I started this journey the day she announced the Eras Tour because my wife mentioned she wanted to TRY to get tickets if we had a chance I have said for a while that my life changed that day SIGNIFICANTLY On top of the incredible music and despite what haters say you have joined an incredible community There are some songs that hit different for men For me it was Tolerate It among MANY others In my last 2 years of being a Swiftie I have been accused of doing it for attention or being disingenuous but let me tell you when you have listened to her endtoend discography more times than you can possibly keep track of or when you cant seem to trim your list of favorites down to anything short of 10 songs you can just ignore the haters and just enjoy the fact that you have found such an incredible artist Welcome
 Same bro Listened to Midnights when it dropped and liked Maroon but thats it Just last year cardigan did it for me too lol and her music eventually occupied my Spotify Went on a deep dive and havent looked back since Never listened to any other artists discography as much as her  shes just a spiffing writer Also tasteful top 5 Evermore is my alltime fav
 As a guy who was 16 when Debut came out it took me a long time to unlearn what I was supposed to think and say about Taylor I even saw her live when she opened for Brad Paisley It took several years and several instances of key songs for me to realize her talent I remember being struck by Teardrops on my Guitar later it was You Belong With Me then Back to December I didn't faithfully begin listening to her until Reputation I wish I had opened my eyes sooner to fully appreciate the first 4 albums releases as they were happening in real time but especially back then many of us were conditioned not to take her seriously
 the lakes and evermore MAN HAS TASTE
 The Lakes is one of my all time favorites Glad to have you here
 There is someone like me
 I became a big fan when Folklore was released What rounds out your top 10
 I just want to fully support male Swifties She writes for everyone and gives voice to emotions we all feel boys and men included
 Welcome
 Oh me too
 Your top 5 songs are my top 5
 Old guy here who hasn't turned her off since the day Folklore came out Recently my wife started loving her too

Title: Most streamed female albums on spotify
Selftext: 
Comments:
 Nice to see Taylor Swift have so many albums at 5B or above or in Evermore's case just below it in terms of streaming
 One problem with this type of data is that it gets confusing with stream splits with OG and TV So for clarity 1989 OG  841B 1989 TV  417B Total 1259 B Red TV 542B Red OG 352B Total 895 B Fearless TV  423 B Fearless OG  279 B total  697B Speak Now TV  269B Speak Now OG  335B Total  604B and Lover is getting 7 million daily streams it's definitely going up that list in the next year
 olivia eating as she should yass
 Kinda insane that TTPD is already at 5B streams in less than 5 months whereas some of those albums are like 5 years old
 Dua Lipa being so high up there is shocking to me I know shes popular but I feel like I dont hear nearly as much about her as I do Billie Olivia etc
 Sour was the most amazing debut album ever  So happy for Liv
 Taylors top 3 being self owned albums Oh we won
 Oh TTPD dont come for them like that
 I am not trying to drag or put Ariana down but it's funny how her fans used to drag Taylor back in 20192021 cause TUN had more streams than all of Taylor's albums Just how much the tables have turned
 Forgive this question but can someone confirm how album stream stats are calculated Is it adding up the number of times each song from a given album has been streamed So if someone had a huge single streamed 9 billion times with streams of all remaining tracks totaling another 1 billion wed consider the album streamed 10 billion times even though the majority of streams is a single song
 A lot of those artists dont have multiple albums to stream So take that into account
 Can we appreciate that The Fame is on there and it was released in 2007
 Why do I have a hard time believing that Lover has the most of ALL of Taylor's albums Someone help me out here Wasn't that album considered a major flop It was certainly my least favorite so I hardly stream it
 Im really impressed with zara larson being there  She's SOO UNDERRATED amazing vocalist
 Liv is the only one at 13B Woot woot
 Curious to know how different the order looks on Apple Music
 Lover is my favorite album and Im confused with it being number one Because it feels like were a small group
 GUYS Lets stream Evermore now It is SO close
 Ariana is obviously one of the biggest artists of her generation but she's not as high up here as I would've thought I guess she kind of debuted in an era where pure sales were still dominant
 Surprised Melanie Martinez is that high
 Let's go Zara
 Can we talk about the fact 1989 wasnt on streaming for years
 SOUR TOP 1
 Wow I cant believe Olivia refuses to be a girls girl and give Billie that top spot jkjk
 Tbh i find it crazy that Lover is 1 I've never really thought of it as such a hard hitter outside of Cruel Summer
 I'm surprised prism isn't here tbh
 Am I just anal or is female album just weird Thats like saying the Mona Lisa is a male painting because of the artist
 The streams of ttpd would be much higher if Spotify didn't just play me the same 5 songs of the album over and over and over
 TTPD already being up there is crazy
 Cool
 Go Billie
 evermore I love you
 Wheres the tortured poets department
 ttpd anthology but not ttpd
 I did not expect Sour to be at the top Thats crazy
 Justice for Evermore
 Whats that between Ariana and Sia 4 riz you have Billie Taylor reputation Rihanna and then That thing with little drawings
 No offence to anyone else but uhm why doesn't our girl have all the top five
 it's so crazy to see lover rising to the top so fast for a while it was so underrated and barely anyone talked about it
 This is Acting is such an underrated pop album so many bops Taylors streams are insane especially when Taylor's Versions exist in top of those Lover being her flop era according to some is nuts in hindsight evermore might be taking that spot
 So coool
 Dua has NO business being so high up Shes a pop girly for sure but its ridiculous to me that shes surpassing masterpieces like Adeles amp Taylors albums
 Where is TTPD Or is the one with the Anthology pic at 526 billion streams supposed to represent TTPD  Anthology
 Can we add all Taylors album How many streams would it be
 Bad bunny is female
 Crybaby That was unexpected Is Melanie Martinez a big deal
 I honestly think the length of TTDP is the only reason its not higher I regularly keep that playing while I sleep and I know its popular Its also much newer than most albums on this graphic so its insane how high it is already
 This looks outdated



Title: 90 Billion Streams and Counting
Selftext: 
Comments:
 Idk why I thinks its so funny that out of everything this is the picture they chose for this milestone
 potentially stupid question what does across all credits mean like all her songs or albums
 
 i helped
 Mind you her music wasn't on Spotify for like three years so this number would be higher
 And this was with her boycotting Spotify for a length of time She'd have gotten to this point sooner if not for that
 Queen
 she keeps breaking records i love it



Title: Watching Anastasia and noticed something familiar
Selftext: Good to know Taylor loves this movie too lol
Comments:
 Idk why this cracks me up so much
 I lahv de Russian ballet
 She would kill a remake of 'Once Upon a December'
 One of my favorite movies as a kid Ok and an adult
 She was clearly enchanted to meet him
 Someone posted recently about fictional characters who would be Swifties and I bet Sophie would love her
 Oh my god I knew I'd seen it somewhere
 So were all rewatching Anastasia today Because I finished it this morning lmao
 And now all the late 80s babies have nostalgia I loved that movie What a great catch
 LOL that's hilarious Sidenote I absolutely love the Donna Lewis and Richard Marx song At the Beginning and the pop version of Journey to the Past by Aaliyah from the soundtrack
 I knew I had seen it somewhere
 I was listening to the Paris song today lol
 The most unexpected cupcake dress sighting ever
 Taylor and Travis in 30 years lol
 Uncanny
 I never watched Anastatiawell parts of itso don't judge but was Anastasia a witch Like the good witch in the wizard of Oz I'm assuming a Disney movie
 Ewww it's Rasputia
 im gonna tell my kids that this was a movie made for taylor and travis
 This is a reach



Title: I made a cover and tracklist for Reputation Taylor's Version
Selftext: 
Comments:
 This but add I Dont Wanna Live Forever TV and I will literally give up my college savings to have this album now
 Your typesetting on this is so good that I had to go have a peak at your profile to see what else you've made Absolutely love this concept
 This is an elegant update to the original cover while still screaming 'reputation' It's cleaner implying she's no longer as bothered by what others say about her Honestly it's perfect
 What about IDWLF
 I need this It looks so good  I'm really curious to see what the Rep TV cover will look like I wonder if she will keep the newspaper theme or ditch it like she did polaroids for 1989 TV
 This is beautiful
 I can tell its fan made because the track list is too readable
 Please girl you just gave me a heart attack  great cover art
 Gosh I can't wait for this I need it so bad esp with us entering Fall soon
 I hate the fact that need isn't on this setlist
 Kool
 amazing but I do require need on reputation Taylor's version
 After hearing it preformed at the Eras Tour recently I hope we get a I Did Something Bad Acoustic Version track
 I hate everyone who thinks shes gonna release TIWYCF Its not her song She wrote it but RIHANNA released it She never got her music stolen She doesnt need it to be rerecorded Now IDWLF is another story That might actually be on rep tv
 I wish shed release Debut first If Dress somehow managed to make the track list for rep there is no way the vault tracks are all that good

Title: Gracie Abrams Recalls the 'Out of Body' Experience of Debuting 'Us' with Taylor Swift at Wembley Stadium
Selftext: 
Comments:
 avoid the ads Gracie Abrams had an out of body experience when she debuted her Taylor Swift collaboration Us during the Eras Tour In a cover story from Who What Wear on Wednesday Sept 4 the Risk hitmaker 24 opened up about debuting The Secret of Us track live with the pop star 34 at Wembley Stadium in London in June We wrote it the way that we played it at Wembley Abrams told the publication She added To see somebody have the ability to in a stadium make it feel like you and her are the only two people there that was hugely important for me to see The Close to You performer also reflected on how the Eras Tour inspired her latest album  and being able to perform it live on the Eras Tour next month I am so fing happy that we get to do The Secret of Us on Eras just because so much of the album was undeniably inspired by the kind of energy that radiates from both Taylor herself and her fans who are just so committed and passionate Abrams said Elsewhere in the interview the Mess It Up singer revealed how performing on the Eras Tour helped her conquer her fear of being onstage I avoided it at all costs Abrams told the publication Once she was able to get in front of the crowd that rewired a huge chunk of my brain Not just in terms of performing and stage fright and that kind of s but in my life Abrams said I told myself that I knew I would hate performing I knew I would be uncomfortable every second that I was onstage and I didn't end up feeling that way at all For the Blowing Smoke singer it was really lovely to be wrong In January Abrams told PEOPLE that opening up for the Fortnight musician was an experience beyond my wildest dreams Being a part of that tour in a tiny way has changed the course of my life in so many ways she said Abrams called Swift an unbelievable performer and the most generous friend It's not lost on me that her belief in me has really just done a lot So I'm deeply grateful to her forever she said
 It was honestly so sweet  I don't know much about Gracie Abrams and I didn't know the song but I was there for the show and loved it
 I see Gracie open last summer and wasnt really into her music but still thought she did good After listening to Us all summer Im so happy I have closing night tickets to see her again I absolutely love this album
 Ive been replaying that footage to death Wish they would release a HQ quality of that performance already heck I would buy another copy of her album just for that live track
 Gracies The Secret of Us album is so good yall Ive been listening to it a lot this summer
 Just bought my daughter and her best friend tours for their second Gracie concert in two years in Australia
 Good for Gracie but she managed a rare thing of silencing a Taylor crowd something that is near impossible
 Nepo babies gonna nepo
 sooo are we thinking theyll add it to the set list since gracie is opening for her

Title: Vote Taylor for VMAs
Selftext: Calling all Swifties please remember to vote for TAYLOR amp FORTNIGHT for the VMAs Voting ends in a few days and a lot of Swifties stopped voting because they thought voting ended already but it has NOT VOTING LINK  Categories that Taylor and Fortnight are nominated in  Artist of the Year Video of the Year  Song of the Year  Best Collaboration  Best Pop  Song of the Summer Voting Opens on Sept 6 FORTNIGHT is nominated  Most Iconic Performance Voting Opens on Sept 10 YOU BELONG WITH ME 2009 performance is nominated
Comments:
 as much as i love taylor i cant be biased and pick fortnight over espresso for pop and song of the yearsummer
 Shout out to Hozier in Best Alternative category He hasn't won a major award since like 2016 and he deserves the world Too Sweet and Unreal is soooooooo good
 Love Taylor love TTPD but fortnight just simply doesnt deserve a win
 Sorry but Fortnight doesn't deserve to win it's nowhere near the best on the album and other songs such as espresso
 I love Taylor but I don't understand how Fortnight was nominated for song and video of the year It's bland
 I just wanna know why Chappell isn't nominated for songalbum of the year Not a single skip on Midwestern Princess
 There are sooo many good nominees this year
 Love Taylor and TTPD but I think Sabrina really deserves her awards for Espresso over Fortnight
 I've said it before and I'll probably say it again I love that this sub is so positive toward other artists It's such a refreshing change from the subs for other artists where everyone is weird and hostile about Taylor
 Voted half for Taylor and half for others who I think also deserve it It will be interesting to see who wins
 I would vote for Taylor but We cant be friend is an incredible video
 Voting for Taylor in all but song of the yearsummer The Fortnight video deserves all manner of awards but the song wasn't the strongest this year
 I voted for Taylor on everything she was nominated I really hope she takes most if not all wins cheering hard here
 Also remember to vote who you truly thinks deserves it Dont feel obligated to vote for Taylor if you like something else a lot more
 Damn it I voted already earlier today
 It didnt appear to let me vote Everything was dead yet the site said I could come back tomorrow to vote again Id sure like to know what it thinks I voted on Im on my iPhone 13 Pro Max I doubt Ill go back
 Power hour doesn't work anymore as the voting period was extended
 I'm voting for her fortnight mv and collab but the rest are going to sabrina
 Vote for Gracie best new artist too while youre at it
 Damn it I voted already earlier today
 I voted for Taylor but I didn't give her the most votes or all the votes where it's not applicable I gave her most for Best Pop and all for Best Collab but not for song or video of the year
 Been seeing people talking about not voting for her on Song of the Summer but Imma give my 2 cents and say that Best performance def doesn't go to Taylor as well Like Madonna amp Britney amp Xtina is there along with Lady Gaga I'm convinced it's just the battle of which gay generation wins
 I really love the fortnight Music video I hope it wins
 YOU GET 10 VOTES PER CATEGORY
 Okay but I totally voted for Eminem as well cause that's hilarious lmao the irony hahaha
 I feel like im the only one who doesnt love sabrina  I have only heard the radio singles tho maybe i need to listen more at some point I guess for me she is like ariana i never have any idea what the lyrics is and it bothers me
 Not sure if Taylor Swift deserved the music video of the year But Tailor Swif sure did

Title: Taylor Swift's grandfather LtCol Archie Dean Swift was a WWII veteran and his experiences inspired her song Epiphany Archie almost never talked about the war but was remembered for his positive
Selftext: 
Comments:
 One of the most beautiful songs she has ever written
 looks like it got cutoff gtTaylor Swift's grandfather LtCol Archie Dean Swift was a WWII veteran and his experiences inspired her song Epiphany Archie almost never talked about the war but was remembered for his positive outlook Later her family discovered he was in some of the bloodiest battles including Okinawa
 And some things you just cant speak about
 Its a beautiful song however I only associate it with my mum who died shortly before this song came out in 2020 The lyrics hit sooo damn hard
 I love that Taylor found a way to weave her family into songs Really sad about what her grandfather faced during the war though Im sure he was deeply traumatized by what he experienced and saw
 Epiphany is definitely instant cry



Title: My boyfriend used to be a hater but today I gave him this
Selftext: This is how I tell him we're going to see Taylor in November after I secured tickets from a friend He hated Taylor because of lies he would read online but I've since converted him to a Swifty since we started dating Her music has actually brought us so much closer together as a couple and I appreciate Mother so much for it He is the Travis to my Taylor
Comments:
 My partner didn't like Taylor when we got together and only indulged me then 1989 was released and he liked the album but wasn't a fan of anything else then Rep came out and I was over the moon got Rep tour tickets my second tour after Red and he was a convert after that tour and seeing her live and living it all He's steadily grown over the years and he was just as excited and singing his heart out in Liverpool this year He's even gone back and said he's started listening to fearless and likes a few songs from that album which is my OG favourite I think for a lot of people they just see and hear the headlines and the number ones but Taylor is much more than what is shown and you have to dig deeper to find the true Taylor and sometimes it just takes a little peek at her and you can't stop looking The picture is of us in Liverpool night 2 on his birthday waiting for the best night ever
 I got my exhusband to become a Swiftie by telling him that 1989 is a GREAT album to workout to He texted me a few weeks ago to tell me he still exclusively listens to Tay when he works out
 My brother has no interest in TS but knows I love her He took like two days and listened to all her albums Hes still not a fan but I was so impressed
 Did he like it
 I think all straight guys actually love Taylor Swift and just pretend we dont listen to her music because its supposedly too girly But a number of times Ive been hanging out with straight guy friends and when a girly song comes on we all know all the lyrics already haha Listening to beautiful women with beautiful voices singing beautiful songs Oh no way that is so GAY Its ridiculous how much effort some guys put into appearing hyper masculine
 How did you convert him Swiftie partner of a hater here
 Thats awesome
 Thats awesome Whered you find that
 That is absolutely adorable I hope all these people leave you alone you're an incredible woman a strong woman just try to keep your information a little more to yourself because people are idiots I wish you the best and Travis I hope everything works out and you get the love that you deserve love you Taylor and Mary Lou Lucas
 Sound like divorce
 Im gonna be 70 one day and Im gonna reminisce how the entire fucking world went crazy over a mediocre artist



Title: What if Red was a pop album
Selftext: Another addition to our 1989 makeovers on her other albums Next up what if Red was a pop album I kind of forgot about Babe but she will be on the country side maybe lol
Comments:
 It is a pop album
 Starlight should have been included it is a great pop track
 Many of these arent pop at least not in the synth pop or dance pop kind of way State of Grace and holy ground are country rock all too well come back be here begin again and better man are country everything has changed and nothing new are folk Even the very first night has country pre choruses and verses The lucky one also feels country pop to me but its a hard song to describe 22 WANEGBT Message In a Bottle amp IKYWT are the only pure pop as in devoid of country and folk songs from Red Red is a country album at heart In fact Speak Now has more pop and rock tracks if you wish you continue this series Enchanted I Can See You Electric Touch Sparks Fly Superman Haunted Better Than Revenge The Story of Us Long Live Mine Innocent Castles Crumbling
 I get upset thinking that I could have had The Very First Night for almost 10 years instead of Stay Stay Stay TVFN is one of my favorite songs
 Great tracklist but i think Girl at home should be included
 Not the treacherous erasure
 It was Everyone could read the red writing on the wall she was going pop
 It is a pop album
 red is already a pop album
 It already is a pop album
 Red is like the countriest song why is it here
 Red is a pop album
 There are still several country and rock songs on here lol
 We wouldn't have all too well state of grace and treacherous
 Feels a bit weird to remove country songs when country has been pop for a long time Phoebe Bridgers wouldn't have been featured it'd have been the original probably nonduet version
 OMG I made a playlist for this too A What if Red went Pop like yours
 is it not
 Give me Treacherous or give me death
 I can't deal with Treacherous goneI think it's ok as a bonus track Or instead of Nothing New
 I wish the very first night was released during the og red era because imagine how cute it would be to end the red tour with it
 This is genius
 I love so many of these songs
 I dont like this stay stay stay erasure
 Um no 10min version



Title: What are some tracklist order choices that you think were purposeful
Selftext: I always thought the juxtaposition of betty to peace on folklore was really clever I don't know if it was on purpose but having betty with the highschool love themes immediately followed up by the first line in peace our coming of age has come and gone is super cool to me What are some other tracklist order choices that you think she did purposefully or accidentally Another obvious one that I've seen around is putting Fortnight as the first track on the album after Midnights
Comments:
 I can fix him loml i can do it with a broken heart the smallest man who ever lived tells a story
 Folklore was pretty clever having the 1 as track one seven as track seven and august the eighth month as track eight 22 after All Too Well seems jarring on the surface but makes a lot of sense once you know why she was so excited to be 22 The Alchemy being track 15 is clever for a number of reasons  Callback to Fifteen and dating the boy on the football team  878715  15 is Travis teammate and friend Patrick Mahomes number
 Cassandra Peter The Bolter and Robin So long London says I stopped CPR after all its no use She literally stopped it by adding the bolter
 I Almost Do  Never Ever  Stay Stay Stay  The Last Time For some it is jarring for me they summon the story with Jake
 Lavender Haze as the opening track for Mindights with the first sentence being 'Meet me at midnight' It's so perfect Also Maroon right after and then AntiHero
 Ready for it could have been nothing but the first track and on the other end of that the manuscript is the perfect closing track Call it what you want and New Years Day always told a story to me as well finally moving on from what everyone thinks of her because even wither her reputation she still found love in herself and others
 I will go to my grave stating that the transition of WANGBT to Stay Stay Stay is objectively hilarious
 To me the most obvious one is Begin Again ending Red Its just so perfect
 Maybe not what you were asking but having Would've Could've Should've as track 19 of midnights is so powerful to me and it's why I ultimately think that You're on your own kid is better being the track 5
 meet me in the afterglow followed by ME
 So High School followed by I Hate It Here This one got me so good on the first listen Thinking back on romantic high school days and emotions and tearing up with nostalgia only to be told 2 minutes later that nostalgia is a mind's trick and remembering all the awful parts of high school my brain selectively forgot
 The Black Dog through How Did It End tells the story of a drunken night She was drinking wine and staring at someones location then fantasized about going to said bar then remembered that her fame is still the albatross around her neck then imagined them both moving on before finally accepting it all
 All of them Its an artist putting together an album all the songs are in the order they want them to be
 evermore to right where you left me she was really like i cant believe i finally found the strength to start moving on and then immediately said just kidding im stuck lol
 Someone pointed out that her debut album starts with Tim McGraw a song about someone elses song and ends with Our Song a love song she wrote for herself as her own song and I cant stop thinking about it
 having false god after soon youll get better nothing like crying about cancer one moment then letting your inner slut come out the next
 All of them She put them all together purposely
 The smallest man who ever lived being the last break up  ex song on the original 16 tracks
 the whole tracklist of reputation tells a story from chaotic obsessive feeling careless romance deeply infatuated heart being high to becoming genuinely carefree and authentically in love the most romantic album of taylor
 Ending the std edition of folklore with hoax and deliberately book ending it with the 1 We were told in LPSS that they were deliberately placed as book ends Opening folklore with a song narrator who is in a better place moving forward and has bravado but then ending with a song narrator who is looking back wanting answers from multiple people and is emotionally raw and vulnerable
 'So High School' gt 'I Hate It Here' Since TTPD was such a giant note toprocessing of the Matty chapter this onetwo punch was an eyebrowraiser for me It seemed like she wanted to imply feeling stuck in a situationship However obviously things have changed since thento the point that I wonder had this album come out around now if she would still keep that particular track order
 right where you left me being followed by it's time to go
 No one has said right where you left me and then its time to go Literally about the inability to move on and then finding the strength to and walking away from something that no longer serves you Criminally underrated pairing
 The whole ttpd tracklist up to smallest man is the Joe to Matty story Down Bad is the only one not in chronological place technically it should be after Smallest Man The Alchemy is about getting back on her feetmeeting Travis To me the anthology is more musings about that whole time period more than documenting what happened
 all too well into 22 is GENIUS really shows that 22 is actually a depressing song if you think about it too hard
 but the story isnt mine anymore closing out TTPD is actual perfection
 Dk if this counts bcs theyre from seperate albums but hits different to fortnight Bcs she answered the final question proposed in Midnights  Is that your key in the door It it okay Is it you Or have they come to take me away with the first line of her next album I was supposed to be sent away but they forgot to come and get me Other than that its robin to the manuscript In Robin Taylor vowing to protect the innocence and childhood of her friend's child after a whole album grieving about how fame and its associations has damaged her own childhood then in the manuscript she finally finds closure in the death of her youth
 they're all purposeful obviously you think they're just thrown onto the album in a random order lol they're akin to chapters of a novel

 Taylor shouldve had wings
 Fascinating work But I think the wings perspective is confusing the wings in the back should be in the front Besides that it looks amazing good job
 This is so pretty I would love a calendar with fairy Taylor
 This is so cute  I love it I agree with uRetrogradePlanet that the perspective is a little bit confusing to look at particularly in the second picture but a few extra lines will fix it no problem Both pictures still look awesome overall
 This reminds of me of a TaylorBritney mix with the fairy wings

Title: Travis Kelce Confirms Taylor Swift Is Drafting Up Plays for Him I Think She Was Just Curious About the Profession
Selftext: 
Comments:
 avoid the ads After Patrick Mahomes recently spilled the beans that Taylor Swift was drawing up plays for boyfriend Travis Kelce the Chiefs tight end verified that she thinking through the playbook During an interview on the Rich Eisen Show on Tuesday Sept 3 Kelce spoke about Swift getting into the X's and O's of football She had just been so open to learning the game she didnt know much about the rules or anythingI think she was just curious about the profession Kelce 34 said I know none of the plays have gotten to Coach Reid yet but if they ever do Ill make sure everyone knows it was her creation he added When asked if Swift 34 creates plays for other players on the team Kelce replied Shes a little biased and just creates plays for me Well see if they can make it to Coach Reids office The news of Swift's interest in playcalling first came up when Mahomes 29 spoke with NBC commentator Chris Simms on Thursday Aug 29 and praised Swift while explaining that she's genuinely interested in the sport The Love Story singer attended her first Chiefs game against the Chicago Bears on Sept 24 2023 when she and Kelce first sparked dating rumors Meeting Taylor realizing how genuine and cool she is that's been special to me because like you said she's the most famous person in the world Mahomes told Simms She's really interested in football she asks a lot of great questions She's already drawing up plays so we might have to put one in the quarterback revealed While discussing whether the attention surrounding him and the Chiefs went up to another level once Swift showed an interest in the sport Mahomes responded I think it's been cool to see the girls and the women that have really embraced watching football
 She's so all in and devoted and genuinely interested in her men when she's in love
 A bunch of football fans are going to lose their MINDS when they get ahold of this information and not in a good way
 Clear eyes full hearts can't lose Hear hear Coach Taylor
 I saw some football fans mad about this and how she thinks she's a football expert now It's so obvious that they're just chatting about his day amp what's he's passionate about It's really sweet
 So funny shes still called the love story singer lol
 This is so cute Imagine if some of these plays actually make it in and play an important role in an important game
 The name of the play Taylor designed is called Shake it Off
 this is so freaking cute honestly me when my bf started teaching me about baseball when we first met lol
 Better yet just watch the actual video on YouTube its nicer to see him talk about her in the interview
 I think this is a joke between him and Mahomes They have some play in mind and they're going to say it was hers
 I think this is mostly tongue in cheek and just something they did for fun once or twice as Taylor was learning the game BUT Andy Reid has famously used a play from a janitor before and the chiefs dedicate practice time to random weird plays so its certainly a possibility but probably not super likely one will actually make it to a game hahah
 This is going to piss off Brads amp Chads and Im completely here for it
 why am i not surprise she's drawing up plays lol
 He knows how to ball she knows Aristotle and how to ball shes actually good at everything
 If we win the Super Bowl on a TSwift play there will be violence in the streets I look forward to it Threepeat
 I think it's also worth watching the interview as well to get the context as he as laughing a lot and smirking and trying to word things correctly
 This is seriously so cute Its adorable that she is so invested in what he does and she wants to be a part of it if she can Just like when Travis appeared onstage
 RED 22 RED 22 HIKE
 writing on 2025 bingo card Taylor gets a Superbowl ring
 We see so many unhealthy relationships every single day and this one has so many green flags If you don't like her move on There are many of us old people that love this relationship She is as interested in what Travis does as he is interested in her music and concerts I love it
 Someone please ELI5
 I think it's so sweet that she wants to understand how plays work and the rules of football SoNot only can they can talk about each other's job and interests but they can share in excitement and enjoyment of them
 I give her full props because I feel I too should be doing this but I struggle so much to feign interest in my husband's science fictionfantasy obsession  You will not catch me wielding a light sabre at one of those conventions even for the sake of love
 This reads like the title of an Onion article I had to do a double take to make sure I wasnt in the CJ sub lol  this is great though
 He knows how to ball she knows Aristotle and how to ball shes actually good at everything
 I dont think Taylor would ever assume that shes got a handle on NFL She just happy learning it for the sake of her man Shes showing up for him
 Ted Lasso Season 4 Richmond FC's new nemesis in the EPL isn't Rupert's West Ham it's Ryan Reynold's Wrexham with Taylor in the role of Nate Shelley's opposite number Travis will be cast as her version of Coach Beard
 Kinda funny that Taylor likely knows more about the sport now than a large chunk of the Dads Brads and Chads that watch it
 Coach Taylor when
 I dont dont understand how football fans are so petty about their relationship I only saw one sub in the whole of the internet that complained about Travis at Eras everyone else embraced the silliness and fun of it Plus if Taylor can get more women interested in football then thats only a good thing right As long as the Swifties dont take over the games with friendship bracelets lol I remember at the World Cup Euros etc here in the UK back in the 2000s the WAGS became part of the football People LOVED seeing Victoria Cheryl Colleen and co at the matches supporting their partners
 As an NFL fan myself that's how you learn the game She might say dumb things in the process but the players will help her improve her knowledge
 Pretty Epic
 NFL queen
 Honestly can't wait to hear what song Travis writes Bet it'll be an absolute banger
 I hope shes drafting a new speech for him if the chiefs win the Super Bowl again I dont think we can go through Viva Las Vegas again
 Genuine question any way I can blockmute names on Reddit an no not Taylor Im already tired of this season and the football talk and I wanna be prepared when this sub will become a chiefs subreddit and yall freak out over the simplest things
 Im In between about this We think its cute but we be mad if Travis drew up plans on how she should redo the Eras Tour However Im biased because nothing annoys me more than someone not in your field telling you how to do your job


Title: Does Taylor have acoustic recordings or demos for most songs
Selftext: On YouTube I found the NPR and Red acoustic sessions Are there more concerts and songs in acoustic form
Comments:
 Official recordings arent super common but the vast majority were sang during the surprise song for the eras tour at least in a mashup And the 44 that were part of the set list are her most performed songs so an acoustic performance is likely
 She releases very few demos but some old ones have leaked The Red demo is the last one I think she released There are a limited number of studio acoustics that have come out but the acoustic songs from the 1989 tour Rep tour and first few legs of Eras gives you most of her songs
 I know Spotify has a couple of her acoustic songs Here's a playlist with all of them I think
 She released some live in Paris songs from right before Covid which includes some acoustic Theres an acoustic of Cornelia Street Death by a Thousand Cuts and The Man that I love Idk if theyre on YouTube but they on Spotify



Title: Lover by the style of 1989  revamped tracklist
Selftext: I didn't expect my TTPD tracklist rework to garner so much attention omg So I felt to make one for Lover as I believe it is one of her divisive albums and suffers from overloading as people say So I devised an alternative tracklist modeled after 1989
Comments:
 I love Lover But I wish it had a better cover This one is sooo much better imo
 How is this giving Lover more than Lover does
 Im guessing SYGB INTHAF ME and YNTCD are vault tracks
 This is cute but I don't agree at all with your tracklist Why do Swifties insist to always cut the fun songs off of lover Or even worse one of the best ones with Soon You'll Get Better
 Not the Me and YNTCD erasure
 Love it Especially the legibility of the font No hate to newer releases but even my 30 year old eyes are having trouble reading the tracks of newer albums
 love it
 I Stan hard that I Forgot That You Existed is the perfect track 1 for the album Before you can fully embrace a relationship you need to turn the page and be done with the last IFTYE is all about that and is perfect to transition from her past to her present at that time Its also so fun
 I loved your last one and this one Not just the new cover but the tracklists are amazing I'll definitely be replicating them on my Spotify Please keep posting more if you have them
 I have always loved that photo it really should have been the Lover cover
 I love this track list so much better Oh wow you completely cut Me Gotta keep you need calm down
 Need is a need
 I love Lover but the tracklisting sure gives me emotional whiplash London Boy  Soon You'll Get Better  False God I like your reimagining of it  also love your covers especially the back cover
 You should make sygb a vault track it still fits lover but it does not fit the main theme at all so maybe a closing track
 omg whenever i try to reorder lover on my own i always put i think he knows first youre the first person ive seen who also does that love this will be trying it out
 this is so pretty if you swapped the man with it's nice to have a friend and included soon you'll get better as an additional bonus track i could definitely get behind this
 I wish she would bring this hair cut and style back its my favourite and suits her so well Love 60s70s styled Taylor

Title: Taylor Swift featured several times in new NFL promo for upcoming season
Selftext: 
Comments:
 When all the Chads and Brads start bitching and moaning remind them Taylor didnt make this ad or choose the content
 No one wants things to work out between Taylor and Travis more than the NFL
 Me if I had to make an NFL promo
 While it is ridiculous she's in it 5 times and people like Joe Burrow Brock Purdy Jared Goff and Jordan Love aren't featured even once people who actually should be in the promo it's understandable  she was the NFL's biggest moneymaker last year and the NFL's priority is keeping Swifties locked in since they know their primary fanbase will always watch no matter what Smart business
 Absurd I dont even know whether to laugh or cry at how desperate NFL is to use Taylor and her fans for their sport
 NFL be NFL and post what's making them a huge revenue boost Also a Dolly Parton appearance in the Dallas Cowboys section
 The fact that they have her chugging the beer is exceptional
 Its actually just so weird for them do show 5 clips of herFIVE
 The NFL is fully shameless
 Lmao this is unreal I can just hear the Thanksgiving table discourse from the men in my family already
 I'm so ready for NFL Taylor's Version Go Birds
 I am an official dad brad chad who has watched football his whole life and my name is Brad and I can't get enough of the Taylor content on the NFL It brings a whole new level of excitement Even made a bracelet for going to Eras tour as well as watching football
 The comments on this post are so weird lmao
 Im already so annoyed and the season hasnt even started yet
 They know what they are doing Getting girls involved in sports again Trying to change the image
 Taylor features exactly 3 times in a 50 clip 30second ad Entire demographic of all white men over 20 Omg why is she in this so much Agh male power the palpable anger of certain people over this VERY small and insignificant feature of her in a short ad space that she definitely didnt choose Honestly for those that are angered please get offline and touch some grass its giving pathetic meanwhile shes bringing actual new fans along for her football era
 Ready for it
 I mean they know shes going to bring viewers in and shes in this advert for a few seconds Not much to bitch and moan about as she didnt make it herself lol
 This is giving severe How do you do fellow Swifties vibes lol
 She also appears briefly in the SkySports promo in the UK
 Love you Taylor but I still don't love football
 Im thinking they wouldnt do this without her permission but I find something kinda weird and brand dealish about how they organize games so she can come and include her in the promo Idk Just a weird vibe
 They also showed Travis at least 3 times without her from what I saw And Jason once So even when not using Taylor they're still going for the highest Swiftierecognizable players I didn't even see a shot of Mahomes' face once so its not because Travvy made it to the big game last season
 And you know what it's definitely working because this is the first year in my 31 years of life that I've actually entertained going to a Chargers game with my dad when the Chiefs are in town imgemotet5_2rlwe1087
 Is this an official NFL clip Its not weird that shes in it its weird thats shes in it five times and like half of the NFLs stars arent The annoying part is the fontstyling of the month names Who chose that
 This is just weird sorry not sorry If she performed for them then Id get it But its just so weird to see a personal relationship used as a moneymaker like this by one of their employers
 meanwhile people like christian mccaffrey and brock purdy nowhere to be found
 Theour relationship is nothing to commodify on  obviously this is not their fault just sad that it is exactly what happens here I wouldn't know how to handle a relationship at her level of fame don't know what would be right for me but I would hate it if my relationship would be used like this Even if this itself is not that deep
 they trying really hard
 Shes gonna get so much hate and 0 for the free promo  I know shes already a billionaire but Id be annoyed
 They shouldve sealed the deal and had the song be Ready For It
 As a football fan I love that t swizzle is involved But showing her in the promos is veryoffputting maybe once with Travis butthis is beyond forcing it Hope she got paid to be in this
 Honestly this felt pretty consistent with how i experienced the NFL last year she was the highlight so it seems fair to me
 Its just annoying to me that any time shes in a relationship suddenly any and all media about her has to do with her man and the parasocial jumps out from the fans so intensely
 NFL accounts haveeee to be trolling all the brads and chads by doing this right This has to be deliberate right
 NFL should really thank their lucky stars for Taylor  look at all of us Swifties now being interested and of course women and Swifties liked football before But for me who had never heard of a Kelce before Taylor outside of not getting the whole Brother Bowl thing and who is now watching games and playing fantasy football they are LUCKY She's bringing in female and nonbinary viewership that they deperately had been chasing to little avail
 Epic trolling
 Watched this video twice thinking what is OP talking about this isnt a TS song Sigh Im a big dummy TS is in the promo
 Im hoping to see a lot of Taylor on Thursday The dads brads and chads can cry harder we dont care Attendance and viewership is up The NFL should go all in with their coverage Its a win for everyone but fragile men
 Taylor and Travis more than the NFL
 i'm sure everyone will be totally normal about this
 I love Taylor but still dont love football
 That's weird and offputting
 Five times I counted
 Has it even been confirmed she will be there Thursday night
 This is literally the reason lol
 I hate this Its just going to drum up more hate Soon she wont be able to go to a game without being booed
 I mean Jason is there and he retired
 Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu nnn
 Her legal team is gonna be BUSY these days One clip can be written off as crowd shots Five  and they better be handing over keys to an owners box Yikes Thats just ICK
 I mean I hope theyre paying her this is ridiculous and I know she doesnt need more money but come on
 I saw her on TV at a restaurant yesterday It was a tribute thing about Travis Kelce
 Marketing is marketing
 But also DOLLLLLLLY
 The men are really outing themselves in the comments
 At this point the next superbowl is gonna have her as the half time performer but it's just her announcing rep TV and not performing at all lol
 they arent gonna like this one
 So not the point but them opening with Aaron Rodgers running onto the field considering what happened during their first possession of that game
 The NFL know their audience
 She's the best thing at this party
 My favorite part of the games is in order Her outfits The foods Fun cheering yay sports Realizing I understand it more than I thought I did
 YESSSSSSSSS
 Idk I think its just cute and represents pop culture Shes a big celebrity having big reactions whos really tied into the games since shes dating one of the players So theyre showing that shes a part of the experience and the culture now lol I dont think its weird or disrespectful Its just facts Its like saying Yoko Ono being associated with The Beatles is weird or staged Big names bring big reputations
 I'm sure this promo was why the haters are working overtime to make fake contracts and other lies on internet to falsely prove that it's a fake relationship For that reason I wish they hadn't used her in the video It's just creating more stressfor them and lies about them Swifties don't need to be reminded she will be there we know That said I wish I was that cute
 It's a little much Dolly got one clip I think Taylor should've gotten two The jacket clip and one other but it is about football
 BUT as the mom of a 9 year old playing football I can tell you the number of youth kids is dwindling The NFL needs a pipeline They need mamas trusting football again I think immediate views are great but if the Taylor effect gets mamas putting kids in football again she might SAVE the NFL I honestly think that's what that's about Who wants to talk about long term effects on the brain when Taylor Swift is a football fan

 My three and a half year old says youre welcome for being responsible for at least 10000 of these views mom play the zombie Taylor swift song again

 I enjoy singing this song Didn't know she made a video for it either
 This video took months from start to finish Planning began in January shooting in May and post production was completed TWO days before the VMAs Must have cost so much
 Anyone else feel 15 isn't a milestone 1 billion sure maybe even 2 billion but 15 You can't just have milestones at half way What about 16 next why isn't that a milestone Anyway congrats I guess on the milestone

 Jessica Day confirmed Swiftie

 David Rose from Schitts Creek is reputation personified from attire to his character arc I feel like TS would have been seen as too pop for him until this era

 Leslie Knope Parks amp Rec
 Deadpool has that vibe I feel like marvel would make a joke in one of the movies about him being a swiftie
 Kelly Kapoor from The Office
 Sue Heck is peak MEHEHE One part cute One part cringe Two parts glitter
 Rachel Green
 Anne Shirley Cuthbert from Anne with an E She would eat up debut and folkmore
 Olivia Benson obvi
 Cam from modern family
 Lexi from Euphoria
 I know Dean Winchester from Supernatural likes Shake It Off but I always felt like that was a joke in Taylors expanse  I always felt like his brother Sam would relate to a lot of her songs though Youre On Your Own Kid The Prophecy The Archer Castiel would also definitely love her
 I know for a fact Micheal Scott would've been a die hard swifie
 April Kepner would 1000 be a Swiftie
 Stewie Griffin is canonically a Swiftie
 If Jo March was on Reddit her flair would be I Hate It Heres 1 fan
 Cam from Modern Family He would have a fire outfit to wear to the Eras Tour

 Usagi TsukinoSailor Moon Invisible String fits so well for her and Mamoru ChibaTuxedo Mask
 Some male fictional characters I think could have been swifties Peeta Mellark The Hunger Games particularly the book version Hes been listening to nothing but TTPD since April Katniss acts annoyed but secretly shes a Folkmore stan Charles HaydenSavage Only Murders in the Building His sortof stepdaughter Lucy gets him hooked and now he listens while making omelets Scott Lang Ant Man He and daughter Cassie definitely went to a Santa Clara show together and traded friendship bracelets with everyone they met Steve Rogers Captain America He thinks Taylor is incredibly talented and a great role model for kids One of his favorite songs is Starlight but it can also be hard for him to listen to sometimes preEndgame
 You nailed it with Josie Imagine Josie saying Taylor's quote about how the worst kind of people are the ones who make fun of people for getting excited about something or however that goesI think she's said something similar a couple times I can totally see it
 Caroline from The Vampire Diaries
 Shoshanna Shapiro from Girls
 pearl she would love fearless speak now amp lover
 Olivia benson from SVU is 100 a swiftie amp reputation girlie Im sorry bc I know Taylor named one of her cats after her but Meredith grey from greys anatomy definitely thinks Taylor swift is overrated amp loves telling ppl she doesnt listen to her Meredith is not like other girls often so that would check out Lastly Beth from the walking dead loves Taylor swift for sure Ofc shes a debut amp fearless girlie Rip bc she never got to hear speak now or red
 Aria Montgomery unfortunately Think she'd love Would've Could've Should've Benedict Bridgerton Dorothy Zbornak
 
 Im so sorry I love this but it reminds me of Justin Bieber and she would have been a belieber with Anne Frank
 Summer Roberts
 Sheldon is without a doubt a Swiftie
 No one cannot tell me that Haley James Scott from One Tree Hill isnt Taylor Swift coded Haley would definitely be a Swiftie
 Meg Griffin I can see her sobbing on her bed to some of the early love songs
 KELLY KAPOWSKI
 Phoebe Buffay would definitely be a total Swiftie I also love how Lisa Kudrow who played Phoebe got invited to the 1989 Tour as a guest
 Katherine Heigls character in 27 Dresses
 Good Omens Crowley and the 10th Doctor David Tennant just kinda gives off the vibe
 We all know he secretly has a soft side so being a swiftie would not be entirely out of character
 Buffy Summers
 Honestly Rosalie from Twilight shed relate to all of Taylors emotional music I can just tell shes a fellow TTPD Folkore Evermore and even Midnights girly
 Caroline Forbes the vampire diaries
 A little on the niche side these days but Mallory from Family Ties And Jennifer would have made fun of her for it while secretly also being a Swiftie Alex would have been vocally antiswift for her misandrist lyrics but dances to Shake It Off in private
 Cameron Diaz in Charlie's Angels  The scene where she's dancing in her underwear I picture her dancing to Shake It Off for sure and then something silly like ME in the club scene
 Amy March and Hermione Granger 100 swifties
 Cat AND Bianca Stratford
 Phil Dunphy from Modern Family He would have taken Alex and Haley to the Eras Tour but he would have been the one crying to every song Also Sheldon Cooper
 Dr Greg House He had mmm bop as a ringtone
 Oh oh and Sansa Stark amp Penelope from Criminal minds
 Every single character on Full House would be a swiftie Uncle Jessie would pretend to be too cool but then he'd be caught secretly covering one of her songs They'd all get to meet her behind the scenes of Wake Up San Francisco Kimmy would somehow almost cause them all to miss the show but they would make it in time Front row seats Michelle would get the 22 hat
 Mulan the man no notes
 Bill Potts from Doctor Who
 Chloe Beale Shes just such uh a swiftie Idk if I need a case for her Shes just sunshine as a person and would love all her pop stuff but would definitely understand all the alt and folk stuff too Oh and the country shed use to annoy Beca

 Carrie White wouldve loved Whos Afraid Of Little Old Me that movie is all I think about when I hear that song
 Damien from Mean Girls
 Oh definitely Chandler
 Penelope Garcia shed absolutely love Lover The pretty bright pastels the fun energetic songs 100 Garcia is a Swifty and by association so is Derek Morgan

 Why is the correct answer Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom
 Joey Potter Dawson's Creek would totally be a swiftie She loves lyricism and overanalysing things She would be a folkmoreTTPD girlie for sure
 Buffy the Vampire Slayer wouldve been living for Reputation during her Angel years Dont Blame Me Dress So It Goes are so Buffy and Angel coded she can kick ass to Ready For It LWYMMD and I Did Something Bad and Im pretty sure she literally says this is why we cant have things more than once on the show
 I Did Something Bad and Dont Blame Me are very Kim Wexler from Better Call Saul coded I cant imagine her listening to Taylor though
 Kaylee Frye
 Will Byers from Stranger Things Especially 1989 he loves his friends more than anything has a lot of anxiety and abandonment issues which fits with the theme of the album
 Damon from TVD and his 'unflinching ability to listen to Taylor Swift' that gets him girls

 50 First Dates
 John Smith from Mr And Mrs Smith He's the 'softy' and the one who shows more emotion I mean he's singing along with Making love out of nothing at all and says I like it deal with it
 This might be out there but I feel like Josie from never been kissed would be a good fit Edit I totally didnt realize the author of the post already said her
 Aerith from Final Fantasy VII I feel like Tifa would be more of a Lana girlie
 Obviously Donna Martin would've been a Swiftie All the times David broke her heart she'd be deep into some track 5's
 Feel like probably Sakura Kinomoto from Cardcaptor Sakura too and probably any of the magical girl anime characters lol Tomoyo Madison definitely would've gotten Eras tickets for them because Sakura is such a big fan Also Mimi from Digimon definitely
 Katniss probably keeps playing TLGAD after the war
 Haley Dunphy
 Kelly Kapoor and Andy Bernard in the office are certified Swiftie
 Jake Peralta in B99 is canonically a massive Swiftie he brings it up constantly Also I weirdly imagine the waitress from its always sunny to be a Swiftie Shed start wearing friendship bracelets and Charlie would start making his own and wearing them whilst the gang berate him
 Serena van der Woodsen would've been in Taylor's squad lmao no explanation necessary
 Tara Jones from Heartstopper has a folklore poster in her room
 Tara Maclay No explanation needed Also Cordelia Chase at first she'd only listen to the big hits but after her character growth on Angel she'd be a huuuge swiftie
