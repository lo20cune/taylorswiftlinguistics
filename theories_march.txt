 This is a clear reference to the dead poets society I don't know how to post pics but it's the I hereby reconvene the dead poets society with the next time of I will conduct this meeting and since such and such doesn't like to read aloud he will be the minute taker and then a quote from a famous author about going to live in the woods because they wanted to live deliberately and fully sucking the marrow out of life seems to fit what's going on with her In this sense I think conduct is in reference to the musical term but maybe not I hearby conduct this tone poem I hereby conduct this meeting of poets Something like that
 Is this a promo or is there a song to find
 Florida Theory This song title has driven me crazy for weeks and I finally have a theory on WHY the three exclamation points are there Staring at it it reminds me of how Id write in a planner if its an exciting eventdate Maybe a big day with Joe was meant to happen in Florida and she had it marked for some time as such Florida and when it finally came it went tragically Just needed to get my guess out there Would love to hear other theories
 I hate to speculate like this but I wonder if anyone is also seeing the connections like I am between bigger than the whole sky and Wouldve couldve shouldve 1 Bigger than the whole sky literally has the lyrics wouldve couldve shouldve in the song I dont think Taylor ever does anything coincidentally I think she obviously did this on purpose I know me and many others kinda had to double take when we first heard it because we knew there was a song named that 2 She very much leans on religious imagery and how she feels she was tainted in some way in her relationship with John in Wouldve couldve Then in Bigger than the whole sky she states did some force take you because I didnt pray I just feel that if something God forbid did happen in that relationship not only would she be questioning these faith type questions because of the age gap and the feelings of being groomed but also it would tie in heavily with having an abortionmiscarriage and the feelingsquestions that situation brings to a persons faith I also feel like that situationtrauma would keep the tomb open and make it ten times worse to heal from that relationship John does strike me as one who would want to keep things hush hush if something like that had occurred And I think it would stem a lot of resentment and feeling tainted or like she got robbed of her girlhood and innocence in yet another way in that relationship I of course VERY MUCH hope this isnt true I love Taylor to death and would hate to think she lived through something like that but it just always crosses my mind when listening to both songs She doesnt have many songs with religious imagery and that much trauma packed into them and those two really seem tied together in some way Also another theory she is somehow talking to herself before that horrid relationship saying she wishes she couldve seen who she wouldve been had he not stolen her girlhood and innocence And Bigger is literally referencing that lost girlhood and how she only knew her young and naive self for such a little while bc of him Anyone else feel they are similar as well
 Happy April Clowns Day friends New thread
 Ok so merch drop TODAY right Hope there are no April Fools tricks up TNs sleeve
 I'm several years late to this but is So It Goes inspired by SlaughterhouseFive I know the phrase comes from that book but it only just occurred to me that she herself was perhaps inspired to write a song about Joe after reading that phrase in the book Its a commonish phrase now so it's possible she wasn't but I recall someone saying she had read Cat's Cradle by the same author
 As I recently checked spotify because I wanted to presave TTPD  openspotifycomprerelease5JeTM9iqdtLFfSFedipKdDsiMOZB MepRbq161xpVZCf7g and as I have observed at her page there is a clip in Chinese I am not sure if all of the people can see this because when I checked my other device its in english I also noticed she added a new date in the events section She added Austin on April 18 which is the day before the TTPD release Any thoughts about this
 I cannot believe tomorrow is finally April 1st We are getting a brand new Taylor Swift album this month Holy crap
 Also this feels like an Easter egg
 Spotify countdown started at days
 Easter egg post has 2 emojis on a post talking about easter eggs
 Evolution of a Snake Podcast Post  anonymous and therefore maybe totally bullsht but everything is possible at this point
 What are people's theories  bets  hopes for setlist changes after TTPD I saw a couple people mentioned that they hope it's just added as acoustic set songs to ensure it's fair to people who already watched it On the one hand I do feel bad about that for people who already saw it before as someone who's going to watch it later this summer I would be simultaneously excited to have a change but would also probably be bummed out if my favorites were cut out from the setlist So I don't really know how to feel hahaha That said I really think she would have a dedicated set to it It seems to be a great way to promote the album and considering the tour will continue until awards nominations and voting I don't see why not Since we don't know the vibe of the album yet I don't know where it could go in the set list  if it isn't filled with a couple bangers I don't know if she would want to close the tour with it Also karma seems like THE tour closer now  Anyway lots of thoughts not formed wanted to share and discuss As a side note Albums dropping always make me feel so close to this community thank you fellow clowns make me so happy Had a very rough couple days and been very very low but having things to look forward to make everything so much more fun
 I know we're all clowning over all the twos but what seems most likely to me is that it's a clue for fortnight being the lead single
 So remember when taylor was promoting ATW MV and she mentioned putting in an Easter egg 3 years in advance Has that come to fruition yet
 I looked back through the photos released right when the Eras Tour began of Taylor performing and I noticed that one of the photos has that white mic Also in that photo there are no background clues to give a hint to what part of the show that the photo may be representing The 1989 mic had the blue lights in the background and the evermore background had the evermore micso I wonder how long she has known she may be touring a new album and practiced some the songs she wrote earlier in the process

 Does anyone have any theories on what album would have came after Lover if COVID19 didnt happen Like I actually cant imagine Taylor doing Midnights after Lover because everyone was so burnt out with pop from her after Lover Plus Lover was received very mixed considering the single choices I fear Midnights wouldnt have done as well if we didnt get the folkmore era before it What do you guys think
 Okay so I know the special editions were already rereleased for sale but I asked for the Albatross for my birthday and was given the manuscript Any guesses on if the special editions will be put back up for sale yet again at some point
 Ok here me out could the 2 fingers mean that she's dropping Rep TV and Debut TV at the same time Or at least within a short time of each other Theres only those two rerecords left and as much as I would love for each TV era to be fully rolledout I dont know if thats realistic considering Debut is her leastpopular and lesserknown album How would she drop Debut TV without it being considered a flop Many newer swifties dont know of it and it doesnt even have a section in the Eras Tour to clarify I actually love Debut and Im not hating on it Plus I think it would be iconic to own her reputation and name back at the same time Do you think that could be what the 2 fingers and constant number 2s that Taylor and her team are giving us mean also disclaimer I just thought of this now and Im not meaning to steal the thunder from TTPD or act as though I want more from her when shes already giving us a lot I just thought it was a fun theory
 I cant believe were now just three weeks away from The Tortured Poets Department It feels so close but so far away at the same time
 When do you think we'll get the length of the songs I really wanna get just a bit of more content before the album drops
 On the Spotify countdown all the tracks are listed as 3 minutes long but I'm assuming that's not accurate Is it just a placeholder time or something
 not a theory but what's up with this on spotify  it has the correct dates for paris but what is this april 18th tour date in austin spotify fucked up lmaoo
 cowboy carters release is just what i needed as a distraction i can wait 3 weeks now  signed a gay swiftie and beyhive member who is here for the kntry bey era
 So apparently Stan Twitter thinks Taylor is on background vocals on the song BODYGUARD from Beyonce's new album COWBOY CARTER
 What if all the 2s means TTPD will have a sister album that will be released this year too Idk I havent theorized in months so this is fun catching up
 deleted
 Do we think she will do a behind the scenes like the long pond sessions but for midnights and TTPD combined
 Anyone have a theory tie in with all these and all the IIs in Beyonc√©s album and both albums feature Post Malone
 Just had to share this sweet video because it just makes me love being a Swiftie
 Not a theory Watching miss americana is so sad that she wasn't nominated for Reputation and how she loved Me It's really clear how much pressure she has on for each album and how much hate she gets Some people put that pressure on themselves but after reading reddit she does put it on herself but the fans Media non fans are so critical and harsh sometimes I can see why she liked Me so much because it was really the first time that she was a self love anthem and I'm not perfect but you won't find anyone else like me She's unique and strong She wouldn't have made as much money as she has or kept fighting on without that spark and strength
 Okay legit question what Billboard records does Taylor want but not have I think that would give us a clue to her releases for rerecords For example she replaced herself with a single on the Billboard Hot 100 with Is It Over Now replacing Cruel Summer Has she ever replaced herself at number 1 on the albums chart For example if she released Rep TV the week before TTPD and they both went number 1 has she set that record of replacing an album at number 1 I'm just speculating but it might be an insight into what recordsnotoriety she wants to go after next Additionaledited thought she could realistically replace both album and song at 1 the same week
 I suspect some sort of announcement or drop April 2nd which happens to be a twosday Possibly announcement at iheart music awards on April 1
 I swear the two thing is just one big troll by Taylor Nation Now the coffee clock post I wish it meant something but I fear theyre just really good at garnering engagement Albeit at the expense of swifties and Im pretty over it lol
 Not the coffee cup again Whyyyyy
 Taylor nation just posted TTPD is 22 days away Im on the  train officially

 SPOTIFY COUNTDOWN IS UP
 I hope Taylor attends the I Heart Awards on Monday because I'm just thirsty for content After the TN Instagram post 2 days ago referencing the awards with the whole Today is your LAST DAY to vote for them at the link in our story  Plus its DOUBLE DAY so you can vote  times as much I'm having intrusive thoughts of some kind of second announcement at another awards show lol Idk guys all the cryptic clues have me grasping at clownstraws Edit downvoters i'll go to my grave with my claim to fame that I accurately predicted an album announcement at the Grammys and you all naysayed me  EDIT 2 that's RIGHT lollll
 deleted
 Now that cowboy carter is almost out promo for TTPD is definitely about to ramp up
 Taylor changed her profile picture to TTPD on Spotify
