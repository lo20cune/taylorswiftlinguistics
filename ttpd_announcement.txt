Comments:
 Idk where else to post this but it is KILLING me how ppl in the neutral reddit are rooting for her to get back with matty How you can possibly hear the album and want the toxic relationship to continue is beyond me
 I can't even sleep anymore  I love her It's ruining my life
 So 4 full listens through and I've clocked why I'm really really enjoying the album As a fan since debut and someone who was raised on country music it's the storytelling and emotive pronunciations but daddy I love him guilty as sin I can fix him I love coupled with the drama and theatrics from the pop masterpieces like Blank Space who's afraid of little old me I can do it with a broken heart It's the way the production accentuates the way she uses her voicebreath control to emphasize certain wordsemotions loml so long london the smallest man who ever lived It feels like a return back home but one where she brought along everything she learned and loved in her travels into pop and indiefolk with her And she put those things together to lean into a uniquely Taylor Swift sound There's still some clunky lyrics but there always has been and I don't think that's a bad thing It adds to the diaristic feel It's the most OG Taylor Taylor has sounded in a long time in my opinion I'm here for it
 So do we know all the meanings to all the songs
 Im emotionally ruined for the rest of the day How am I supposed to have a productive day now
 I am not even gonna be able to function tomorrow because I have to hear them all at least one more time ALL of them
 Surprise songs first thoughts BLACK DOG I just dont understand how you dont miss me Loveeee the old habits die screaming part A solid solid break up song Like this one a lot Tail between your legs youre leaving imgonnagetyouback this one is also fun Feels like whatever the album is that also includes Florida I can do it with a broken heart whos afraid of little old me Swagger to it This is also really confusing because the closeness to get him back by Olivia Rodrigo feels like a provocation especially the lower caps The Albatross this one feels evermorefolklore good in my book I dig it Richer lyrics to me Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus  Well this seemed To have some revelations Would Travis or Matty have bullied Joe in school If you want to break my cold cold heart just say I loved you the way that you were Great line You needed me but you needed drugs more Whoa If I sell my apartment  Cornelia street Sounds like another Aaron song to me I like How did it end Okay I love it immediately Piano and breathy ghostly vocals opening are great I wonder who is guesting Sounds like someone else but maybe not But then she sort of killed it with overwrought lyrics and more spelling of lyrics Hmm Wish it was slightly more restrained So high school wait what album is this What year is it This whole song sounds different You know who to ball I know Aristotle Is this about loving a jock Yep Is it also kinda weirdly weak like Alchemy IMO Also yes I couldnt finish listening to it largely bc Im tired I hate it here basically about Joes agoraphobia becoming hers Second mention of being a precocious child Not a huge impression either way first listen ThanK you aIMee the letters spell out KIM This is obviously about Kim Kardashian as well as a childhood bully I dont mind the song A reprisal of Mean The Kim thing feels dumb LET IT GO MY GIRL Otherwise enjoy the song lots of feeling I look in peoples windows I like this one a lot It feels like a next gen folklore or evermore song The prophecy like the guitar opening very much And as I listen I dig this song too Its a little and weird like peoples windows and a bit witchy as well Cassandra another evermorefolklore type song I LIKE Gonna make a mini playlist of these I think to listen to on their own Bloods thick but nothing like a payroll A nice little clasic Taylor revenge  scorned or spurned woman song I have no idea what gossipy thing this is about it Kardashians PETER I love this song The vocals and piano and simplicitypower of the lyrics and themes This is good Taylor writing IMO The Bolter I dig this song quite a bit Lyrics hit for me It couldve been even brighter and poppier but really like as is Though my kid wouldve loved fewer f Bombs  Robin another pretty piano ditty but Im getting tired I wondered briefly if this was about a secret child lolmaybe for one of Blake livelys kids Anyway sweet song The manuscript This is about Jake All too well 10 min movie How the story belongs to the fans now Hm My faves are the EVERMOREFOLKLORE cluster here AlbatrossChloe Then I look in peoples windows through to Peter Thank you Aaron the piano man
 I may have to call off work today so I can process this double album

 I am simply unwell The clowning The theories The double album I will have to call out of work tomorrow
 Well here we go again see you in another fifteen songs guys
 I put something in my work chat about not being insufferable tomorrow but its gonna be really hard Instant faves are Whos Afraid of Little Old Me and The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived I wasnt completely wrecked like I thought I would be But this might be my favorite album so far I have the bonus track CDs arriving on Monday so Ill be patiently waiting for those
 What is everyones favorite song I like Florida
 Theres another countdown

 i had a dream last night that fortnight sounded like cardigan including the lyrics and melody except after the chorus the lyrics turned extremely sexually explicit weird
 When they say it's dropping midnight on April 19th do they mean the midnight between the 18th and 19th or the midnight between the 19th and 20th
 What a missed opportunity to call one of the songs this ones for you you know who you are
 Did Taylor saw the Solar Eclipse totality on Monday
 Ranking the track titles from the most to the least bonkers 1 Florida 2 But Daddy I Love Him 3 I Can Fix Him No Really I Can 4 The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived 5 Who's Afraid of Little Old Me 6 My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys 7 Fresh Out the Slammer 8 The Tortured Poets Department 9 Loml 10 Down Bad 11 Guilty As Sin 12 So Long London 13 Clara Bow 14 Fortnight 15 I Can Do It With A Broken Heart 16 The AlchemyThe ManuscriptThe BolterThe AlbatrossThe Black Dog
 Do we think we'll get a final deluxe version of the album with all the bonus tracks Dying of FOMO by not buying all the record versions but my budget couldn't handle it  hoping to still hear all the tracks though
 God this album has perfect timing I cant be ripped to shreds The irony is this album was announced while I was with the person who is gonna make me relate to this album Like literally at their house So just impatiently waiting here to get my heart ripped out
 Im feeling real depressed rn so if taylor could drop one of them tracks for me to wallow to thatd b great
 Ok here me out could the 2 fingers mean that she's dropping Rep TV and Debut TV at the same time Or at least within a short time of each other Theres only those two rerecords left and as much as I would love for each TV era to be fully rolledout I dont know if thats realistic considering Debut is her leastpopular and lesserknown album How would she drop Debut TV without it being considered a flop Many newer swifties dont know of it and it doesnt even have a section in the Eras Tour to clarify I actually love Debut and Im not hating on it It would make a lot of sense to drop it at the same time as another album Plus I think it would be iconic to own her reputation and name back at the same time Do you think that could be what the 2 fingers and constant number 2s that Taylor and her team are giving us mean also disclaimer I just thought of this now and Im not meaning to steal the thunder from TTPD or act as though I want more from her when shes already giving us a lot I just thought it was a fun theory Btw alongside this I thought I would just share a thing I think shes going to do for Debut I think shell give Debut the most vault tracks to make it more of a big deal We know she wrote hundreds of songs around and before the time of her selftitled album I reckon shell release a whole bunch of them as vault tracks to make up for the fact that its a less popular album
 Anyone know if there will be a Target exclusive CD I'm only seeing a vinyl right now
 Anyone know why it says coming 21 April 2024 on Apple Music
 Happy World Poetry Day
 itunes is selling a 8 second clip of the new album for a pretty great price make sure u but it and then the album
 what does the video of taylor talking to benjamin mean
 i think it will be thematically like the album red and stylistically like midnights folklore and evermore maybe with some reputation sprinkled in
 I'm a bit confused the first TTPD coveralbum announcement included The Manuscript but when I look up the different versions I see 5 one with no bonus track and then each version with the 4 bonus tracks So is the cover for the album only no extras the same as the cover for The Manuscript Also will any of those extras be on spotify or the album only version
 After that video of Taylor talking to Benjamin new theories have been popping up that this is like the brother album to EvermoreFolklore sister albums Now I cant stop seeing Benjamin related things  like the colors of the variants are the same as his coat colors
 How will streaming work All songs except for ANY bonus tracks
 I'm putting this here so LET IT BE KNOWN that I am predicting all the The tracks to be some of the best of her career Has anyone picked up on the fact that out of all her albums TTPD has the most songs with the word the at the beginning of the track title In her entire discography not including TTPD Taylor only has 14 songs that begin with the word The TTPD has 7 songs alone that have the word The at the beginning Notable mentions are The Other Side of the Door The 1 The Moment I Knew The Outside The Last Time The Archer The Last Great American Dynasty The Story of us The Lakes All of these songs are SO good and have some of Taylor's best storytellingsongwriting I don't know if this means anything but I feel like it's significant in terms of the quality of songwriting
 I hope we get a single soon or even a snippet Im dying to know what this album will sound like
 Does anyone think the variants still represent the five stages of grief If we go with the theory shes released variants representing four stages of grief and she said whats been released is the final variant Am I delusional or do we think there may be a fifth collectors edition with all four songs released on the variants so far and a final fifth song representing the final stage of grief
 Im so in love with this type of theme for the album I think its my most favorite album theme now All of her album concepts are great though so its really hard to choose one
 Have yall seen the leaked lines It KILLS ME and I have never been this excited for a TS album
 Not sure if anyone has talked about this because Im new to the page but Joe has a group chat with a couple of his friends  previous cast mates called Tortured Band Club I wonder if she got the idea from that
 What does everyone think the new TTPD merch will look like I am guessing she will be selling it on the Eras Tour
 I really hope its not another synth pop
 Also on the me variant the bottom picture does not look like Taylor's hair at all That's not her haircut or color It looks like Sabrina's hair It could just be the way it is but it looks face framed cut
 Did everyone see that the patch logo is very different It can still possibly be Cail upside down but with this patch it just looks straightforward Cd 11
 Um Charles Beaudeliere wrote this POEM called The Albatross ampx200B Often to amuse themselves the men of a crew Catch albatrosses those vast sea birds That indolently follow a ship As it glides over the deep briny sea ampx200B Scarcely have they placed them on the deck Than these kings of the sky clumsy ashamed Pathetically let their great white wings Drag beside them like oars ampx200B That winged voyager how weak and gauche he is So beautiful before now comic and ugly One man worries his beak with a stubby clay pipe Another limps mimics the cripple who once flew ampx200B The poet resembles this prince of cloud and sky Who frequents the tempest and laughs at the bowman When exiled on the earth the butt of hoots and jeers His giant wings prevent him from walking
 But daddy I love him On Jimmy Fallon Taylor and Jimmy did a whole bit about a selfie They were comments about seeing his brain through his nasal cavities She mentioned that Jen Stein was a poet I looked her up and saw she had a book called Occasionally I remove your brain through your nose A clue  I look and see she was published in Lenny Letter which gave me a Taylor connection The poem is here  Its about Sylvia Plath She was a definitive tortured poet One of her collections is called Ariel In the collection there is a poem called Daddy It may be a coincidence but I felt it was interesting
 Is anyone gonna listen to this for the first time high
 Will the Bolter edition really be limited like colored 1989 TW or more like 5 midnights versions that are still available
 Am I the only one thinking that the TTPD photos look like a midnights photoshoot but in black and white Im afraid 'cause I really love midnights but I wouldnt want her to give us another album with the same sound I wish this album was something different new I guess Ill have to be patient and wait
 I kind of wonder if we'll find out where Taylor was on April 29th with this album
 The Bolter announced and cover dropped
 New song
 Opened tik tok to leaks I LOVE the sound and hope they are real but also HATE THAT IT WAS SPOILED WITHOUT ASKING RIP I have to stay off the internet for months now are you kidding Ugh Leaking is so disrespectful to Taylor and to the fans
 So there are leaks on TikTok AI or real
 
 Oh my goodness So when evermore came out I was like hey that's kind of a fun word and it makes me think of 'quoth the raven nevermore' but it's evermore that's kind of cool lol Guess who that poem's by Edgar Allan Poe possibly the most tortured poet of all tortured poets ever How long has this ACTUALLY been in the works
 I feel like this will be an album of Sweet Nothings
 If taylor is going for a witchy vibe I think that was hinted with willow witch edition on Spotify just like how we got the folklore sleepless nights chapter as a hint for Midnights Although I think the theme of tortured poets will be poets and old Hollywood starsglamour Also the theme can include women highlighting emotionally tortured women women tortured by menexes Also Feminism
 I wonder whats different this time around that the tracklist leaked so early and theres ALLEGED leaks already on TikTok
 I think tortured poets is songs based on actual poem names from real poets like I think daddy I love him is based on Sylvia plath's daddy I imagine these poets that will be chosen will all have negative experiences in there careers making them tortured poets The poets chosen I think might all be female or had issues with relationships the media mental illness or something that Dammed their career wrongfully because I believe that's how taylor feels

 Around Midnights taylor mentioned about the 3 pens she uses when writing songs and how each one corresponds to a theme or vibe for the song Do you think she was dropping hints about her next three recordsMidnights being the glittery gel pen  Interesting how she mentions poetry and poet in describing 2 of the 3 categories
 I hope the sound is more laid back like folkloreevermore maybe with more touches of speak now that's what the photos are giving me but I have a sinking feeling it's just another pop album I wouldn't hate that but going off the song titles it lends itself more to a stripped back sound I guess we'll see
 This just hit me if TTPD is a breakup album on the cover of Midnights Taylor is holding the lighter bc shes about to burn down the Lover house
 On my birthday nice
 Just googled the significance of the release day April 19th It's National Clean Out Your Medicine Cabinet Day World Jackal Day Poetry And The Creative Mind Day Education and Sharing Day National Hanging Out Day and much more
 I just did a relisten of Lover as a whole album and TPD is gonna wreck me  Listening to London Boy I remembered the total shock I felt when first hearing that theyd broken up That song is just so filled with love and joy Folklore and Evermore were cloaked in fiction even if they had some truth Midnights was presented as nods to her past But this album is the true follow up to Lover Its blue or I guess suppressed to black and white ink other half I know its a bit parasocial but its just really really sad that an album so filled with hope and love will have I love you and its ruining me as its closest sibling Track five being Farewell London implies this duality between them too I also think TS was smart in waiting for the shock and emotion to die down before releasing it The crowd that put flowers on Cornelia St wouldnt have been able to handle a break up album in real time TS seems happier now in a new relationship so that also helps calm things down But relistening to Lover Im realizing how saddddd whats coming is and Im not ready
 Everyone keeps talking about how But Daddy I Love Him is a nod to Harry Styles Yet when I saw that song title thoughtThe Little Mermaid is about a girl who gave up her voice for love which seems a whole lot more sad I think it's a full Joe Alwyn album Thoughts
 I dont see a digital copy with bonus track available on her store Is it sold out or was not ever available
 Just saw this quote attributed to Confucious on social media What the superior man seeks is in himself what the small man seeks is in others Immediately remembered that one of the tracks on this upcoming album is The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived and I wouldn't be shocked if this quote somehow came into play in that song somehow I don't know how exactly but Taylor would find a wayshe loves taking quotes and whatnot like that and subverting them in her lyrics
 I just put it together in Dear Reader she says burn all the files desert all your past lives and then she burned the Lover house down and wrote TTPD She has been leading us down this road for a looooong while and we totally missed it

 I keep seeing on TikTok and other places that the album is registered as synthpop but no one is actually referring to any sources Where is it registered as this I've also seen people claim that it is registered as synthpop on Apple MusicSpotify but the album doesn't exist in either of these places yet Are people just repeating the same rumour with no evidence Please help
 Anyone else get false god vibes Its what I got from the cover but cant see people thinking similarly
 Is there a way to pre save it on Spotify yet
 has anyone noticed that when TTPD launched there was a 72 hour timer for orders but it is now gone yet all the same items are there
 
 It's going to be a great album I just have trauma in that department
 YALL SO LONG LONDON HELLO JOE WILL BE SLAMMED IN THIS WHAT THE FUCK
 A couple thoughts Does anyone else see the possibility of a connection to law and ordercrime with the files and department Im interested in what fortnight might be about Did anything significant happen over the course of two weeks Also The Manuscript Did Joe break up with her by handwritten note It seems plausible for someone pretentious like Him ETA why the hell with the downvotes Am I not allowed to share thoughts
 How do we keep track of presales I bought mine first day but I'm curious to see if TTPD is keeping up with Midnights
