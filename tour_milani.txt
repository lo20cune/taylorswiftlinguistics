 Wow the whole thing still feels surreal I went on n1 fully planning to stand in the back of GA and have some space to breathe and dance Got in 15 minutes before Paramore and the right side was empty I ended up in like row 6 or 7 from the barricade on the right side of GA I could see her so well I will never recover
 I am going to one of the shows in Hamburg and have a question about merch Is the merch different from the onlineshop I was at an avril lavinge concert last month and did not buy anything I thought I can buy it online but it they do not have the same shirts online I do not want to make the same mistake twice
 I'm so hyped for the thankyou message  I hope there will be the next clue
 The mashup of nite 2 WAS everything
 cried tonight during getaway carootw Never cried during a concert before got home an hour ago and the post concert depression is already hitting hard

 so guys how are we gonna clown a connection between the new speak now dress and reputation taylor's version
 removed
 Which TTPD dress did she wear on N2
 I was looking forward for a Mr perfectly fine song And getway car too Really i had expectations but i was afraid it would not live up the hype It did you're in for a treat if you got tickets for her next shows Also big props for the free water bottles handed for the whole duration of the concert
 I'm almost back at my hotel but man have I not recovered from these surprise songs  I was already over the moon with Mr Perfectly Fine the she started playing Red and I didn't believe it I still don't believe I actually sang the bridge of both Getaway Car as wel as OOTW with Taylor and 65k other swifties I will ride this high until the day I die
 Please tell me I was not the only clown who attended n2 who had a heart attack when the piano suddenly broke a few words into Getaway CarI totally thought that was a skit to announce reputation
 I didn't have a parasocial relationship to Taylor until I was at Milan night 1 singing SEI BELLISSIMA to her and now hearing her say there's just no crowd like the Italian crowd Oh I'm toast
 Ok I sat next to a group that was PISSED when I went to the bathroom two times Hours apart Im sorry we paid the same amount of money I carefully planned my bathroom breaks for the songs I dont need to seespecific eras breaks They were also filming the entire concert and mad I interrupted their phone time Be present and enjoy Am I wrong
 17 of people got trust issues
 Man I miss the time before Mastermind I just wanna scroll and find out what the surprise songs were  respectfully I dont give a shit about yalls scores
 got home today from my last concert yesterday thanks for this amazing experience blondie
 My avarege score is 62 I keep putting King of My Heart for guitar because from what I remember it's been a long time since she played it But don't even know what to pair it with went with if this was a movie got the fearless part correct
 me after I saw tonights surprise songs happy for you though
 The 5yearold won Mastermind today in our group of friends He likes that Taylor Swift is sparkly and the song Bad Blood He went for chaos and it worked out for him
 I'm BACK super late But tbh I think the new Speak Now dress might be my official favorite SN dress
 I got 81 on mastermind My highest score ever I was at 0 until 1989 and got every outfit 100 correct after that I also guessed a red song on guitar and rep on piano
 Another swiftie who hand created their era tour outfit for tonight
 you guys reminded me that I can check prior history of mastermindand immediately wish I hadn't My average score is 52 I think I also slightly do better when Travis is there Gonna be a long last month Also to comment on the streamer I thought he was charming but hopefully by the third show he can stop singing Always grateful for the streamers but just Maybe one asmr show
 So glad Reddit is working again  Stats Mr Perfectly Fine was performed for the second time on the Eras Tour and also the second time ever having made its debut in Pittsburgh in June of last year Red was performed for the fourth time on the Eras Tour and the one hundred and ninth time ever Getaway Car was performed for the fourth time on the Eras Tour and the fiftyseventh time ever Out Of The Woods was performed for the fifth time on the Eras Tour and the one hundred and fourth time ever Red has previously been performed in combination with Daylight at the City of Lover concert in Paris and The Manuscript at the Liverpool stop of the Eras Tour Getaway Car has been performed in combination with august and The Other Side Of The Door at the Melbourne stop of the Eras Tour and with The Bolter at the Edinburgh stop of the Eras Tour Out Of The Woods has been performed in combination with Is It Over Now at the Buenos Aires and Paris stops of the Eras Tour and Is It Over Now and Clean at the London stop of the Eras Tour This is the first time Mr Perfectly Fine has been performed as part of a mashup This is the first time a Fearless Taylor's Version vault song has been played since Mr Perfectly Fine was played in Pittsburgh last June 394 days ago that was 13 days after the first Fearless vault song was played in Chicago You All Over Me There are four vault tracks remaining unplayed from Fearless or twothirds of the vault There are a total six songs remaining unplayed from Fearless We actually passed this milestone a minute ago but I wasn't watching it oops Across all of her headlining tours Taylor has now played more songs from Midnights than she has Taylor Swift album Also Taylor has now played Karma live more times than she has Dear John
 Does anybody know what Taylor said before the piano songs Something about yesterday's crowd
