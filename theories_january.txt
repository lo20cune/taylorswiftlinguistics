 New megathread for our February clowning manifesting Reputation
 I would be surprised now if she announces Rep TV in Tokyo That may have been the OG plan but I feel like now she wont want to announce anything superbowl weekend and risk overshadowing Travis

 I think Australia is getting the rep announcement I don't know which show selfishly Sydney N2 please but I think Australia is getting it over Tokyo
 I took a small break from clowning but I'm back  I know that she is very intentional with dates but what if she has 2 plans for announcing REP TV 1 if she wins the Grammy for album of the year or maybe even record and 2 if she doesn't win announcing on tour in Tokyo I'm also still on the Feb 16th release date theory even though that's highly unlikely at this point But I will believe it until proven otherwise
 13th Grammy lets goooo
 Would love to see her win album of the year again is she projected to win or is it tough competition this year
 Taylor Nations recent post  photo and caption  is a copy of a post Taylor herself made while rehearsing for Rep tour  posted February 5 2018 Six years from that is next Monday the day after the Grammys Im even more convinced that shes going to announce the night of the Grammys not at the event but on social media
 Has anyone else put forward the idea of a surprise release of Rep TV tomorrow Feb 1st is National Serpent Day in the US I haven't seen anyone mention it but I may just be a bit slow Edit spelling and extra info
 I just wanna know when the eras tour will be available to purchase and not rent
 Its finally February tomorrow Get your clown noses ready
 No theories here Just hopes for TS 11 this year since the last two years have been so crazy
 Would not mind an album cover like this for rep tv
 Have people been speculating that she'll release the Rep tour movie back on streaming at the same timeish that she releases the TV
 This might be late news but I noticed Taylor no longer has pinned posts on her insta

 Any ideas for what the rep TV vault puzzle will be Or will there be no puzzle rip SNTV  to emphasize no explanation just reputation I think something revolving around newspapers would be really fun
 How many variants do we think rep TV will have 4 like 1989 Or I thought it could be two variants like the original Deluxe Editions with the grey and the orange magazines Or it could be three with one letter of rep pictures on each sleeve like with the 1 9 8 and 9 on the backs of 1989 TV I hope it's not more than that Any theories And the deluxe colors could be orange red and green with the standard edition just being blackwhitegrey PS I'm afraid I'm not making too much sense as my brain is still ridden with a cold sorry
 Where did the TaylorArgylle conspiracy come from Did Taylor also have her cat in a bag just like the Argylle kind
 Does anyone think she might not announce Rep TV on the 10th I feel like the Super Bowl could overshadow it a bit
 sooo do we think shes attending the super bowl any confirmation regarding that she has shows on the 10th tokyo and 16th melbourne of february  the SB is on the 11th in las vegas i personally think its possible but not so sure she would do this since she needs rest
 According to HitsDD she might perform at the Grammys  Edit shes not performing
 So uh TampT or Dynamite has gotta be a title on TS11 Calling it now imgemotet5_2rlwe1087
 Man we could have reputation tv announced SOON Surely after the grammys at least but SOON Im getting giddy Im excite
 What are you guys thinking about how the Rep TV cover is going to look
 in tree paine we trust
 Guys she is currently unsearchable on twitter
 Does anyone have more thoughts on whether the snow globe playlist on Spotify references anything beyond the lights up tilfebruary bit in the description Like if any of the songsartists listed could be hinting towards ideasthemes for future projects andor collabs I've only recently started listening to the playlist itself it's pretty nice and a fair number of songs had caught my attention so I'm curious if any caught your attention as well
 List of dates most likely for Taylor to announce Rep TV 1 Feb 7th Tokyo N1 Come on First show of 2024 what a way to start the year I feel like a Tokyo announcement is likely because of its importance to Reputation end of Rep Tour its in the End Game music video and also the subtitle thing for LWYMMD which could be nothing but I find it strange that none of the videos for her other albums have this glitch 2 Feb 10th Tokyo N4 Really similar reasons to 1 except she could build the suspense over the four shows and culminate with announcing it on the last one 3 Feb 16th Melbourne N1 This one is mainly for the 112 day theory but additionally it is the first Aussie show and is being played in front of 100000 people so a pretty epic way to announce 4 Feb 26th Sydney N4 This is the final Feb show and Aussie show which makes me think that it could be a contender Similar to 2 it allows for her to build suspense across the month and culminate with announcing at the last show Additionally when written using the Australian dating system its 262 which is another way to write 26 divided by 2 which equals 13  When I dont think shell announce outside of a show including the Grammys She takes the Grammys quite seriously and I think it would be out of character for her to announce an album here Thoughts
 I feel like she is going to announce Rep TV at the Grammys I feel like 216 is the biggest date being floated around but HEAR ME OUT   1 The 1989 Taylor's version The S looked like a snake followed by 10NS 10N the grammy nominations were announced on November 10th there were some other hints to the Nov 10 date  ie the picture with Jack Antonoff 2 The grammys are 2424 she loves numerology what a great number 3 The eras tour clock always starts on 224 4 It's the 66th Grammys 5 She got 6 nominations the artists control how many they submit for 6 It is her 6th nomination for album of the year 7 The black nail next to the 2 it has to be February for the announcement 8 Feb 4th 24 6 9 Taylor nation posted today about being nominated for 6 grammys I just needed to post this somewhere I know there are a lot of crazy theories all of the time but this one just seems so clear If not the coincidences are crazy Would love to hear what everyone else thinks
 What is TN up to
 It'll never happen but just wishfully putting it out there I need Taylor to collab w DaughterElena Tonra when she hopefully makes a third sister album to folklore and evermore someday imgemotet5_2rlwe1069 That would complete me
 guys
 With a possible Rep TV announcement imminent Im starting to think about what might sound different on the rerecording Heres a list of who did what songs MaxShellback Ready For It End Game I Did Something Bad Dont Blame Me Delicate So It Goes Gorgeous King Of My Heart Dancing With Our Hands Tied Jack Look What You Made Me Do Getaway Car Dress This Is Why We Cant Have Nice Things Call It What You Want New Years Day We can definitely expect Jack to return for his songs and based on 1989 TV Christopher Rowe will probably do the Max Martin and Shellback ones I do wonder if Shellback will return for some songs as he did do Wildest Dreams I quite liked Christopher Rowes work on 1989 TV even Style which I get is controversial so Im quite hopeful for Rep TV I know they will sound different but as with all the previous rerecordings Ill adjust to them over time
 How do you think Christopher Rowe will do at producing Ready For It Taylors Version
 Do yall think Taylor is going to the Grammys I hope so  then she can drop Rep hints
 Yall cowriters were just revealed for the fourth Bleachers album and Aaron Dessner is Jacks cowriter on drumroll please Hey Joe Im gonna scream
 When Taylor Nation and Taylor herself are going all out with Rep hints but it's still not February
 What is this on insta
 Any ideas why ivy moved to the top of her Spotify playlist
 Not a theory but more like an idea for Taylor if she's reading this and looking to do some kind of a surprise for the first stop of tour this year So as we all know the Tokyo shows won't have any openers it's only two weeks away and there's still no update about it so I think it's pretty much confirmed and I think there's one way that she can make up for it by adding one more surprise song so there's gonna be three surprise songs in each night in Tokyo but it's not just any surprise songit's gonna be one of the song from the reputation TV vault tracks  So here's how it would go on the first night Feb 7 don't acknowledge about the lack of opener and do the show as usual until the secondpiano surprise song Then instead of diving into the stage go back to the mic and talk about not having an opener etc etc and that there's a surprise Then ask everyone to look at the screen and BAM reputation Taylor's Version cover is on the big screen and it's out in two months I honestly don't really care about the release date it could be anytime she wants And then say that she's gonna sing one more surprise song and it's one of the song from the rep TV vault tracks Maybe don't say the title and let swifties guess and go mad online and after that continue the show as usual I know that she's not gonna do this but a fan can only dream Especially since I'm going to one of the Tokyo dates I think that would be fantastic
