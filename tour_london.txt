 I was so happy I got to N6 after trying to get to GermanyPoland and missing out Travelled from Ireland and met my London bestie and we did the Eras tour Definitely feels like a dream A fabulous dream
 Does anyone know when the tour poster for London will be released  never cared about those posters but suddenly I would love to buy this one
 Oh my goodness I'm watching the tour movie AGAIN today  I'm home from work and my husband is out of town and it's so freaking comforting I don't know what's wrong with me but I could watch this show a million times and I'm really getting in my feels that there's no show for two months and then when it comes back it will only have a few cities left and I won't be able to ever see it in person
 Why does it feel like it never happened Like I was never at the show I bought a ticket a year to the date before my London show and then it happened and it was over and I feel like I cant remember it or was able to absorb it  I was also exhausted and realised Im not 22 anymore same age at Taylor so maybe I should have rehearsed for this

 Not me missing the tour and watching theovie tonight
 Trying to crack the abbreviation code for TSITE on a braceletanyone know
 One of those awful annoying and disgusting fans that were supposed to attend Vienna here I've been fully aware all along that we would hear something after London and I simply wanted to grieve the loss of my show with other fans sadly it was clear that even that wasn't to be tolerated I am incredibly saddened by how awful this community has been towards the people meant to attend in Austria due to a very vocal minority I said this week that I'd expect there to be a backlash if she DID speak out now by non Vienna fans and here we are the comments are starting to come in abusing 200000 people somehow represented by a few hundred idiots online This whole debacle has been crazy from seeing the beautiful amalgamation of fans in Vienna come together and grievecelebratebe present together for those evenings and the awful toxic abusive and vile behaviour on social media has given crazy whiplash These fuckers wanted everyone at those shows dead including Taylor it's so so sad that this community and many others decided to focus on point scoring and fighting than coming together in a way they've got a little bit of what they wanted
 I am astounded that peoples trust in Taylor was so thin they FLOODED instagram with comments with lyrics and comments about being left behind or feeling betrayed as fans The internet has a knack for jumping to conclusions before they actually know anything and then arguing and acting like they know the exact situation going on just because they read some articles

 Taylor said something about Vienna in her insta post
 Thank you Taylor for calling out those annoying Vienna fans I FUCKING TOLD YOU SHE'D COMMENT WHEN SHE COULD
 Been thinking about this the whole day the fact that she sang the lines 'little did you know your home's really only the town you're just a guest in' in the city that was her home for so many years but isn't anymore now  and the fact that the next stop of the tour will be Miami  'take me to Florida'
 See you all September 11th
 Such an amazing night The boy who got the 22 hat was so adorable Tears were shed
 I think last nights performance of Florida has convinced me that actually we might need a Florida music video I don't see us getting more than 2 more MV's so my betshopes are for Down Bad and Florida now That being said I couldn't stop thinking today how amazing it'd be if her final single and MV was The Alchemy and a bit like Please Please Please with Sabrina and Barry we get a Travis cameo in the MV
 Has anyone seen how many people tuned in for the ICDIWABH music video premiere last night
 I am still stuck on the performance of Florida It was so good Florences voice gives me chills every time
 Can't believe the European leg is over I loved watching the livestreams with you and of course going to my show If I calculated correctly the remaining shows start at 1 or 2 am local time so I'll definitely won't watch every show anymore
 when does she usually post her thank you posts
 Did anyone else catch the Florence and the Machine song they played in the stadium before the show I had a gut feeling it was an Easter egg
 pic could be better but it was amazing last night  1010

 last night was one of the absolute best nights of my life waited for so so long but got the exact barricade spot i wanted and it was definitely worth it heres a photo from when she started singing florida and i totally lost my shit so long london
 Florida is such a great song So underrated The performance fits with thebrest of ttpd set so well
 The BBC has had at least 6 reporters covering the Wembley run
 Not the best audio but found a pretty insane view full video of florida
 We're living though music history with the eras tour I hope she releases a live album of ttpd songs please
 Can anyone tell me what time we expect the Miami shows to end Ive been so busy with a newborn I havent watched a livestream til the end but making the trip to Miami And do we still expect her to take the stage around 8pm Thank you
 Does anyone have tips for US leg tour tickets Is it absolutely unhinged of me to fly to NOLA  Florida in hopes of securing tickets I have the worst fomo
 Managed to guess 23 of the surprise songs correctly I know everyone guessed SLL but still and Im still only in the top 67 of mastermind players today
 I know we didn't get Rep but truly Florida Was such a cool surprise I screamed out loud when it started alone in my office lol I'm really glad it was the end of the day and almost everyone had left
 What an amazing night
 Wait so did yall know the music video was coming ahead of time because there was a countdown to the premier There was absolutely no service at Wembley so I didnt get any notifications but I was walking out after karma and saw the video start and said what the fuck is that lol
 Does anyone think theres a glimmer of hope that Taylor appears at the DNC
 WHAT A SHOW Made it home and eating Burger King in my hotel room Three surprises I am Taylors favorite sorry everyone
 so do we think Florida is officially on the set list thats a lot of rehearsals for one night and it shouldnt be done during the acoustic set because the drums are such an important part to the song but also so is Florence or maybe im just trying to see it live when i go to NOLA ahhh
 Y'all that new Eras Down Bad sweatshirt is gonna be here tomorrow Just got the delivery notification The speed of her merch shipping has gotten so much faster
 Did she do Florida after So High School or did she cut it for tonight Literally the only 10 min of the show I missed and Im dying to know
 Hi guys Our official statkeeper isn't here today happy birthday to ufalldiewakefly by the way so I figured I would step in for them again and give you all some stats As if there hasn't been enough going on today  Death By A Thousand Cuts was played for the fifth time on Eras tour and the seventh time ever having most recently been performed the last time Taylor was in London London N1 Getaway Car was performed for the fifth time on the Eras Tour and the fifty eighth time ever having been performed most recently Milan N2 So Long London was performed for the first time ever tonight Also our surprise addition to the setlist tonight Florida was performed for the first time ever as well Death By A Thousand Cuts was previously performed as a mashup with Babe during Singapore N4 and Hits Different during London N1 Getaway Car was previously performed as a mashup with august and The Other Side Of The Door during Melbourne N1 The Bolter during Edinburgh N2 and Out Of The Woods during Milan N2 So Long London marked the third time during this tour stop the fifth time during London overall and the sixteenth time on the European leg that she has done a surprise song by itself with no mashup Additionally Florence Welch becomes the twelfth different special guest to perform with Taylor during this tour and Jack Antonoff becomes the third repeat guest during the acoustic set after Aaron Dessner and Gracie Abrams and sixth repeat guest overall With tonight's performances we have now officially completed the standard edition of THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT And we are only one song away from completing THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT THE ANTHOLOGY TTPD becomes the tenth album to have its standard edition completed leaving only Lover incomplete and this is unlikely to be completed as Soon You'll Get Better is the only remaining unplayed song There are now just seven songs remaining across all of Taylor's albums that have not yet been played on the Eras Tour and six five that have yet to be played ever And that's that What an incredible way to end the European leg of the Eras Tour As usual I am not our regular statkeeper so if anyone happens to catch a mistake or ends up knowing more than I do please feel free to correct me
 Ive been to a lot of gigs in my time but this was one of the best Ive ever been too cant remember a time I have enjoyed myself that much Massive respect to Taylor and her team for doing what theyve done throughout this tour
 Im putting my clown wig away until 2025
 Core memory forever I can die happy So long London
 I just wanna say That was one of the best nights of my life And I didnt even go into the stadium Thank you to everyone who spoke to me I will never ever forget you
 Are these little cats in the left Gold white and black
 Ok I know the leading clown theory didn't work out for you all but we were SPOILED today Florida featuring special guest Florence Welch DBATC x Getaway Car featuring special guest Jack Antonoff AND a music video for ICDIWABH We really ended the Europe leg of the Eras tour with a bang See you all here in two months for Miami N1
 Listen I missed everything  how did she announce the music video
