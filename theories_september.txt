 Imagine she shows up to the VMAs in the all green 1989 outfit
 I saw this theory about My Tears Ricochet on Instagram that the lyrics reference her older songs that were sold I didn't have it in myself to go with grace  State of Grace from RED And you're the hero flying around saving face  Superman from Speak Now And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake  LWYMMD from rep Cursing my name  The Way I Loved You from Fearless Wishing I stayed  AYHTDWS from 1989 Look at how my tears ricochet  Teardrops from Debut And I'm not sure if it's legit or reaching Has this been discussed before I wasn't around when folklore dropped Link for reference
 It's a Friday and the 13th next week  plus the VMAs  Toot toot
 Had a dream last night that Taylor released an album titled Winter Taylor's Version It included her OG holiday album songs rerecorded and Christmas Tree Farm of course But then she also added remixed holiday versions of 'tis the damn season Lover evermore Back to December right where you left me Midnight Rain Begin Again The Moment I Knew I Look In People's Windows Forever Winter and Fresh Out The Slammer It was honestly a banger
 I have a question for our statistics and excel people As far as TS Instagram grid alignment of folklore posts she reputation posts Has she ever released anything or made a significant announcement when the grid wasn't aligned Can somebody of our good investigators answer that Btw I just love the stats posts they are so interesting  especially about the clothing choices and song selections I wish I was that smart So I just want to give recognition to our statistics keepers
 I know people are clowning for Rep TV to be announced and released in the next few weeks or so but would she really announce Rep TV or Debut TV without doing a vault post for them on Instagram Is there enough time between the 11th and the 13th for that 1989 was SO hyped and she still did a massive vault puzzle I want a new TV so bad but I also want the vault puzzle and clowning with my fellow Swifties We were ROBBED of a Speak Now TV vault puzzle AND a TPPD track list reveal game Im okay waiting if it means we get the hype and fun  I also want to say that there is a theory of happiness that sort of says happiness is made up of three things waiting for something experiencing something and remembering something For me hyping up the next TV with all of you is going to be so fun listening on the release day and posting here with you is going to be so fun and fondly remembering it all will also be amazing I understand the impatience but they will come and it will be worth it
 Could anyone who has done the Swift Alert brackets before help me out what does seeded mean And also am I supposed to be able to see the brackets cause I can only se the picture in too bad res to read anything
 Why do people keep citing the Billboard rules around preorders for why they think a surprise drop wont ever happen again The rule says that preorders only count toward first week sales if they are shipped within the first week of an albums release I genuinely dont understand the argument because if an album is dropped the same day its announced hence it being a surprise drop preorders wont even be a factor There would be no preorders The album would be available to purchase and be streamed digitally or shipped out physically from her store immediately Is it just getting the album on retail shelves in time to count for first week sales people are worried about I guess I can see how that might be hard for the average person to pull off but it wouldnt be impossible IF thats even what she wanted to do There are so many different strategies she could choose for rolling out physical copies
 We're only 25 months away from the holiday dropwhat are we hoping gets restocked
 I have my clown nose on for a rep TV announcement at the VMAs September 11th and rep TV release on September 13th I know that it wont happen but Im wishful thinking
 I had a thought of maybe she's delayed Rep and Debut after seeing the financial success of variant covers for Poets and 1989 so shes gone back into the studio to shoot more covers and different coloured vinyls hence a delay  im definitely kidding taylor I beg you don't do this
 I had a dream that she announced Debut TV at the VMAs instead of rep TV but somehow Ice Spice was a feature on Tim McGraw Taylor's Version
 kicks door down DO YOU REMEMBER

 Since nothing's happening in September VMAs but please don't start saying Rep TV what do we think Taylor's going to do for the end of the eras tourher birthday I don't think she can go without taking advantage of her birthday being on a Friday this year so I'm hoping for Christmas EP TV or Eras Live Album
 I just found the draft lyrics for Everything Has Changed The lines make many references to the love interest being a Gemini All I feel in my stomach is butterflies for a Gemini etc Do we think they just did this because it rhymes or was there a Gemini in her life at the time Conor Kennedy Harry Styles Zac Efron and Cory Monteith are not Or could it have been someone in Ed's life I know she changed the lyrics but I find it interesting that this was the first draft and wonder if it points to the song being inspired by something different originally
 Everyone out here clowning for Rep andor Debut A few stray Evermore LPSS truthers left Some woodvale clowns who refuse to leave the restaurant Eras documentary theorists are growing And Im wondering Is anyone else just clowning for the Christmas EP TV Ive clowned every fallwinter since rerecordings started  Im losing faith
 New month same clowns
 I doubt anything major will happen She might go to the VMAs at most but Ill doubt shell announce anything this time I think shes mostly going to enjoy her time off
 Another month in The Tortured Clowns Department
 For once I haven't really heard any or had any clown theories that I want to hang my hat on Maybe something will emerge as the month goes on but I'm not really expecting anything to fuel clowning until the tour resumes in October While I get the theories about Rep being announced at the VMAs I'm not really buying it She's announced albums at the VMA and the Grammys in recent years and I don't feel like she's going to do it a third time I could be wrong of course and I do get the significance of Rep being born from the Kanye incident at the VMAs but I am still not feeling convinced enough to start the clown car She got a lot of criticism for the Grammy announcement of TTPD Also it's on 911 After Vienna I really cannot imagine her announcing an album on the anniversary of 911 I think she would be blasted for that by the press
 ICDIWABH THE DOCUMENTARY
 Hey clowns Lets try this again imgemotet5_2rlwe1072
 Ive gotta say that I love how well TTPD has done bc its one of my favorite albums but I dont think it will come back to 1 and its honestly hard to say if well get another single or MV bc ICDIWABHs MV was not so much a MV as it was a tour video which is still great lol but tour vids have historically ended eras  TTPD has kinda gotten an era within the Eras era and Im not entirely sure that she intended for it to have an entire era though I do think commercial success was expected I feel like it was obvious that she was using the tour as a vessel for the rerecords and new albums Midnights TTPD but she also says in the intro to TTPD that this period of the authors life is now over the chapter closed and boarded up  which makes me question how long she really wanted to keep its era going All of that said why would she have kept I Did Something Bad for so long before she played and why did she not wear those last two 1989 combos I think she really planned to egg Rep TV in Vienna and with everything that happened she just decided to wait a while Ill be fine if she doesnt announcerelease Rep TV this year and maybe she wasnt even planning to but I think there were enough eggs that it was clear she was going to do something with it Plus the tour is a perfect vessel for her to reclaim all of her work though I know commercial success has taken the priority more than we thought it would matter to her at the start Edit I also want to say that Im not gonna pretend to know what Taylors gonna do but I think that should go for everyone bc we can speculate and do our theories which is so fun Im glad we all get to do them together all we want but were never really going to know what shes planning until she decides to make it clear yk Edit 2 she also did her European leg tour wrapup post and started it with in summation which sounds like closing remarks for both the Europe leg and maybe even TTPDs era idk but its weird shed do that bc its not like everyone doesnt know were in the TTPD miniera rn
 I think we will wake up one day with rep TV on all music streaming services No announcement at all Would be epic

 Hey besties Are you ready for it
 ITS MY FAVORITE MONTH OF THE YEAR I was born this month thats why but also FALLLL
 Im still dreaming of a Reputation tour outfit change as the hint of an announcement maybe at the last show Its just so odd to me that she has so many outfits and thats the only one that has stayed exactly the same
 Just recorded the VMAs So excited
 Im getting nervous she wont endorse which would be disappointing given the Miss Americana Doc Celebrity endorsements shouldnt impact much but they do I think she could help with registration and get out the vote efforts And its gonna be close  we need all the help we can get Do you think shell do something
