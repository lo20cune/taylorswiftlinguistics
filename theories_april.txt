 I just had the idea I think what makes taylor so liked musicianbeautis she is still a teenager At heart
 Edit wrong thread
 Hi clowns come join us in the May Megathread
 Random thought I had but I Can Fix Him No Really I Can sounds to me a bit like a Beyonc√© song References to Texas halo dangerous man the range I remember in the leadup we also wildly speculated that all the Department verbiage implied lots of collabs instead of 231 Bey and Tay were doing some light promo together before the album dropped and with Cowboy Carter seems like it'd be in both their wheelhouses Maybe there was a collab planned that fell through for some reason Or was switched future remix version to come
 April 2024 when the double album became reality you will always be famous
 ALRIGHT 3 CLOWNS If anyone has time to spare I want to call attention to this massive Twitter thread that goes over every 3 hint so far Theres A LOT more than I listed in yesterdays comment Check it out when you get the chance so you can understand the reasons Im clowning so hard
 Is there a hidden countdown on Spotify Every time I open up the Spotify app on my phone I see a 3 instead of my icon image Is anyone else seeing this Could it be hinting any a drop for Friday Full on clowning now
 can't be the only one hearing her talking in the drum roll of imgonnagetyouback It could be Jack producing style but I think I might be an easter egg
 Keeping the clown car rolling now that Im back from work I saw TN chose to use the Fortnight lyrics that says touch 3 times It may mean nothing but it is another instance of 3 so Im marking it
 does anyone else think the no midnights in Paris lyric change on Apple Music is a hint about her tour stops in Paris like is that how she's changing up the setlist it seems crazy but
 No theories just wanted yall to know I started sobbing during The Black Dog  that song touches my entire soul Theres something so visceral when she screams SCREAMING like I lose it every time
 Tour merch on the site again
 This might be a reach but literally could create a whole novel based on the relationship of Peter and Betty I feel that Betty is Peters apology to her And now we have Bettys response to the apology in Peter Was it said or were those words the secret heart song that they never exchanged  the world may never know Edit no I do not know the background of who actually is Betty and Peter in real life I just feel the songs are connected to each other The purpose of this post is not to debate who is who its just a girl wanting to express her love for both the songs and her opinion on them I may dive into it later but right now I want to just sit on this Here to swifties supporting swifties and creating a welcoming environment for everyone
 It has been brought to my attention that this all thats on the web store  New merch incoming
 All my F1 fans manifesting Tay is at Miami this weekend and theres a picture with her and Alonso I will just laugh hysterically and love it sooo much
 If there is a third album I think it is reputation We know the error was 3 2 1 DPT which backwards is Tortured Poets Department 1 2 3 Reputation is the beginning of the story It also seems to me that The Anthology was written at the height of her depression as she was still in the thick of it TTPD is the final part of the story she's processing this heartbreak by looking back on it Part 3 TTPD Part 2 The Anthology Part 1 Reputation Also you can't overlook the 1 2 3 let's go bitch connection lol Reputation also fits the black and white color scheme I'm not really convinced that it's being announced 53 and I definitely don't believe there will be a surprise drop but I do think reputation is the other piece of the puzzle If I'm wrong I'll never be upset about new music over a rerecord lol
 Oh we get a new Theory thread tomorrow imgemotet5_2rlwe1066imgemotet5_2rlwe1087
 I hereby enter into evidence my proof of a third installment of TTPD Florida has THREE exclamation points
 No midnight in Paris lyric on Apple Music for I Hate it Here So Ive seen people mention this lyric but hasnt seen much speculation about what it could mean The lyric change isnt present on the version of the song in the clean album and Im not sure what lyric is on the hard copies Love to know what everyone hears on which version cause the audio sounds spliced when I hear No midnight in Paris It doesnt flow like how if Id been there Id hate it suggesting it was recorded separately and laid on top of the existing audio Honestly Im not sure how deep her Easter eggs or hints go but Ive come to assume that shes crazy so Ive allowed myself to be crazy too The changed lyric says No midnight in Paris and in the song Paris one lyric says Let the only flashing lights  be the tower at midnight Id easily believe its just meant to be a parallel if the audio didnt have inconsistencies because thats too much of a specific single lyric change to be accidental And what do you know the line in Paris referencing midnight in Paris has a Tinker Bell lighting the top of Cinderellas castle gold sparkle which touches the top of the Eiffel Tower in the lyric video The Eras tour resumes May 9th in Paris and well 6 years ago on May 8th 2018 was the opening show for the rep tour I feel like this type of Easter egg is pretty in line with how she likes to hint at stuff but it doesnt stop there In Karma MV with Ice Spice theres a scene where they both use lassoes One is blue the other is goldyellow The mist coming from the typewriters in Fortnight is the same color Last week I noticed the intro logo for the Disney app changed and its the exact same colors These colors are also prominent during the entire Rep era for the Eras tour movie On top of that all Promos for the Eras movie being added to Disney feature quite a bit of the rep set with Ready for It being the chosen audio Personally I think these are hinting at Rep Tour movie coming to Disney likely being announced a fortnight from release of TTPD this Friday and available to stream midnight on May 9th Either that or shes even crazier than I think and shes hinting at a Rep TV announcement Regardless something is happening May 3rd Idk for sure what it will be but having 14 ticks on the timetable for release date where the first single released is called Fortnight is too one the nose to be nothing  This one felt like a stretch but Post Malone released an album in 2022 called twelve carat toothache Coincidentally the first track on that album is titled Reputation and the album has the same aesthetic and color scheme as Rep I cant find anything else that links these but felt like it was still relevant Taylor seems to specific for that to be a coincidence if Im being honest
 Not exactly a theory but didn't know where to put this where people would actually see it  But I just realized that the beat in So Long London is a dying heartbeat I googled it When we are dying the heart rate can pick up again but it's getting weaker and finally stops The beat in So Long London is the heartbeat of a dying relationship

 There are 11 days between Matty's birthday and the day TTPD was released TS11
 Clowny Island really looking busy tonight
 I just wanted to say that you guys have made a really hard day a better day for me  a year ago today my childhood best friend died by suicide and I was dreading today but reading all of these theories has really just made me laugh and smile today so thank you clowns Also sorry I know thats such a random heavy topic
 A different leaker posted about her extending the tour in MarchI dont trust these usually but I guess well see
 All these threesmaking me feel like the essay I wrote in February about her using threes wasnt crazy after all it probably was I noticed the threes before the twos tbh
 Okay I am coming at this theory from a place of definitely NOT thinking we need a new era or new music right away after we have been fed so generously  but a few hints on social media have been making me wonder what is next The theory Taylor is going to phase out her TTPD era rather quickly and introduce her new era with the color lilaclavender Why I'm clowning for it To kick this off when the album dropped Taylor took to Instagram and posted about how this album made her feel free from these stories Within that caption she writes This period of the authors life is now over the chapter closed and boarded up This makes me think she's going to wipe her hands clean of this era rather quickly It also makes sense that she'd want to move right along considering how much she's moved on in her personal life from the content of TTPD Next I think a lot of us heard lilac short skirt the one that fits me like skin in imgonnagetyouback and then immediately recognized a lilac short skirt in her first Youtube shorts video This was also the first piece of media she posted that's in color on her social media since the beginning of the TTPD era was announced not including the TTPD timetable video that features us leaving the Midnights room She's also sporting some lilac nails in this video that are on full display while she's sewing This video features snippets from her personal life there is nothing to do with the making of TTPD in it Her following two shorts are back to sepia and both revolve around content for TTPD one is the making of the album and the next video is effectively announcing a TTPD set on tour What's fun is you can see she's wearing the same lilac skirt in her latest vid too Then after a sea of sepia promo on her Instagram for the last few months we get this post  and it's in color Very muted washed out color but the first polaroid of her singing on the couch is lilaclavender AF There's also this older photo at the Oscar De La Renta atelier screenshotted from this video which features a Loverlooking bodysuit but with a lilac skirt TBH this throws me for a loop because it would be truly wild for her to introduce TS12 and then promptly add it to the tour as well I'd think she would have to extend the tour for that Perhaps it would just be hinting at a future lilac era or perhaps it's not even a bodysuit made for Taylor My guess is that she's going to wear this version of the Lover suit on May 9th to hint at the forthcoming era Anyway the end If you've seen any other hints of lilac around lemme know
 Ok well Ill continue with the 3 clowning because I need to remain head of the clown department and Taylors new post has 3  emojis

 Random thought if shes going to add TTPD to the setlist is she going to change the intro as well
 I have now seen multiple insiders say that theres more tracks to be released from TTPD I dont 100 trust it but it seems plausible
 GUYS HER STORY ON INSTA What do you MEAN Her 6th song on speak now  Edit wrong album Im tired lol
 Does anyone have strong feelings about which songs will go on the ttpd setlist for eras And where it will fit I don't have strong feelings but my thought is that it will go after midnights because this way she only has to transition to ttpd and not out of it If she adds it between acoustic and midnights for example she would have to transition from acoustic to ttpd then again to midnights If it's at the end she wouldn't have as much transitions to make Idk Also if she adds this to the eras tour movie they would just have to add it at the end again not having to focus so much on how to set up the transitions visually As for the set list she has to play TTPD for the TTPD set no I know it's not a bop but to maintain stamina she can't do all bops right
 Happy High Infidelity day to all my fellow eastern time Swifties
 Is anyone else thinking that The Black Dog may get a music video The black dog in the Fortnight mv as well as the sound in the Fortnight teaser sounds similar to the sounds when Taylor sings old habits die screaming
 Am I the only one thinking that nothing significant is happening on May 3rd I love to clown but I dont think something as big as new music is going to happen The most I can see happening is a MV She just dropped 31 songs spread across 2 albums I can wait a little bit for something music wise
 am i the only one confused about the cat paw prints used to hype up this era i dont think they were dog prints to easter egg the black dogas no other bonus tracks had that promo easter egg just curious maybe may 3may 9 will have answers
 not me thinking the weird formattingspacing of her new post means something  i need to chill lmao
 May 9th cant come soon enough what do you mean by that Taylor Surely shes got something up her sleeve because that wording is so suspicious
 I think shell announce Rep TV sooner rather than later
 May is shaping up to be a big clowning month imgemotet5_2rlwe1066 bring it onnnnn
 When do you guys think she would announce new tour dates if she actually extends the tour Could that be whats coming on May 3rd
 Just a thought The black nail on the coffee cup is on 2 Is 2 for the second month Feb Is 2 a day of the month Is it for 2am Or is it military time 1400 fortnight
 Who else is on the clown train thinking something major might happen a fortnight after TTPD I'm seated imgemotet5_2rlwe1087

 Taylor reposted 12 reviews of TTPD starting 5 days ago  If that's a countdown 12 days it ends May 3
 This was posted by this insider who Im sure doesnt know as much as they pretend they do but it will be interesting to see if theres any leaks in here about stadiums like before
